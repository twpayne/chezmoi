		"\n" +
		"chezmoi is written in [Go](https://golang.org) and development happens on\n" +
		"[GitHub](https://github.com). The rest of this document assumes that you've\n" +
		"checked out chezmoi locally.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Developing locally\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi requires Go 1.13 or later and Go modules enabled. Enable Go modules by\n" +
		"setting the environment variable `GO111MODULE=on`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi is a standard Go project, using standard Go tooling, with a few extra\n" +
		"tools. Ensure that these extra tools are installed with:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    make ensure-tools\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Build chezmoi:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    go build .\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Run all tests:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    go test ./...\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Run chezmoi:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    go run .\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Generated code\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi generates help text, shell completions, embedded files, and the website\n" +
		"from a single source of truth. You must run\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    go generate\n" +
		"\n" +
		"if you change includes any of the following:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* Modify any documentation in the `docs/` directory.\n" +
		"* Modify any files in the `assets/templates/` directory.\n" +
		"* Add or modify a command.\n" +
		"* Add or modify a command's flags.\n" +

		"\n" +
		"Bug reports, bug fixes, and documentation improvements are always welcome.\n" +
		"Please [open an issue](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose) or\n" +
		"[create a pull\n" +
		"request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) with your\n" +
		"report, fix, or improvement.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you want to make a more significant change, please first [open an\n" +
		"issue](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose) to discuss the\n" +
		"change that you want to make. Dave Cheney gives a [good\n" +
		"rationale](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/02/18/talk-then-code) as to why this is\n" +
		"important.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"All changes are made via pull requests. In your pull request, please make sure\n" +
		"that:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* All existing tests pass.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* There are appropriate additional tests that demonstrate that your PR works as\n" +
		"  intended.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The documentation is updated, if necessary. For new features you should add an\n" +
		"  entry in `docs/HOWTO.md` and a complete description in `docs/REFERENCE.md`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* All generated files are up to date. You can ensure this by running `go\n" +
		"  generate` and including any modified files in your commit.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The code is correctly formatted, according to\n" +
		"  [`gofumports`](https://mvdan.cc/gofumpt/gofumports). You can ensure this by\n" +
		"  running `make format`.\n" +

		"* The code passes [`golangci-lint`](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).\n" +
		"  You can ensure this by running `make lint`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The commit messages match chezmoi's convention, specifically that they begin\n" +
		"  with a capitalized verb in the imperative and give a short description of what\n" +
		"  the commit does. Detailed information or justification can be optionally\n" +
		"  included in the body of the commit message.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* Commits are logically separate, with no merge or \"fixup\" commits.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The branch applies cleanly to `master`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Managing releases\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Releases are managed with [`goreleaser`](https://goreleaser.com/).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"To build a test release, without publishing, (Linux only) run:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    make test-release\n" +
		"\n" +
		"To create a new release, create and push a tag, e.g.:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    git tag v1.2.3\n" +
		"    git push --tags\n" +
		"\n" +
		"[brew](https://brew.sh/) formula must be updated manually with the command:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    brew bump-formula-pr --tag=v1.2.3 chezmoi\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Packaging\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you're packaging chezmoi for an operating system or distribution:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* Please set the version number, git commit, and build time in the binary. This\n" +
		"  greatly assists debugging when end users report problems or ask for help. You\n" +
		"  can do this by passing the following flags to the Go linker:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"  ```\n" +
		"  -X main.version=$VERSION\n" +
		"  -X main.commit=$COMMIT\n" +
		"  -X main.date=$DATE\n" +
		"  -X main.builtBy=$BUILT_BY\n" +
		"  ```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"  `$VERSION` should be the chezmoi version, e.g. `1.7.3`. Any `v` prefix is\n" +
		"  optional and will be stripped, so you can pass the git tag in directly.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"  `$COMMIT` should be the full git commit hash at which chezmoi is built, e.g.\n" +
		"  `4d678ce6850c9d81c7ab2fe0d8f20c1547688b91`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"  `$DATE` should be the date of the build in RFC3339 format, e.g.\n" +
		"  `2019-11-23T18:29:25Z`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"  `$BUILT_BY` should be a string indicating what mechanism was used to build the\n" +
		"  binary, e.g. `goreleaser`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* Please enable cgo, if possible. chezmoi can be built and run without cgo, but\n" +
		"  the `.chezmoi.username` and `.chezmoi.group` template variables may not be set\n" +
		"  correctly on some systems.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* chezmoi includes a `docs` command which prints its documentation. By default,\n" +
		"  the docs are embedded in the binary. You can disable this behavior, and have\n" +
		"  chezmoi read its docs from the filesystem by building with the `noembeddocs`\n" +
		"  build tag and setting the directory where chezmoi can find them with the `-X\n" +
		"  github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/cmd.DocDir=$DOCDIR` linker flag. For example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"  ```\n" +
		"  go build -tags noembeddocs -ldflags \"-X github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/cmd.DocsDir=/usr/share/doc/chezmoi\" .\n" +
		"  ```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"  To remove the `docs` command completely, use the `nodocs` build tag.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* chezmoi includes an `upgrade` command which attempts to self-upgrade. You can\n" +
		"  remove this command completely by building chezmoi with the `noupgrade` build\n" +
		"  tag.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* chezmoi includes shell completions in the `completions` directory. Please\n" +
		"  include these in the package and install them in the shell-appropriate\n" +
		"  directory, if possible.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* If the instructions for installing chezmoi in chezmoi's [install\n" +
		"  guide](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) are\n" +
		"  absent or incorrect, please open an issue or submit a PR to correct them.\n" +
		"\n" +

		"\n" +
		"[The website](https://chezmoi.io) is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)\n" +
		"and served with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) from the [`gh-pages`\n" +
		"branch](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/tree/gh-pages) to GitHub.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Before building the website, you must download the [Hugo Book\n" +

		"## How can I quickly check for problems with chezmoi on my machine?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Run:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi doctor\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Anything `ok` is fine, anything `warning` is only a problem if you want to use\n" +
		"the related feature, and anything `error` indicates a definite problem.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## What are the consequences of \"bare\" modifications to the target files? If my `.zshrc` is managed by chezmoi and I edit `~/.zshrc` without using `chezmoi edit`, what happens?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi will overwrite the file the next time you run `chezmoi apply`. Until you\n" +
		"run `chezmoi apply` your modified `~/.zshrc` will remain in place.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## How can I tell what dotfiles in my home directory aren't managed by chezmoi? Is there an easy way to have chezmoi manage a subset of them?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`chezmoi unmanaged` will list everything not managed by chezmoi. You can add\n" +
		"entire directories with `chezmoi add -r`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## How can I tell what dotfiles in my home directory are currently managed by chezmoi?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`chezmoi managed` will list everything managed by chezmoi.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## If there's a mechanism in place for the above, is there also a way to tell chezmoi to ignore specific files or groups of files (e.g. by directory name or by glob)?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"By default, chezmoi ignores everything that you haven't explicitly `chezmoi\n" +
		"add`'ed. If you have files in your source directory that you don't want added to\n" +
		"your destination directory when you run `chezmoi apply` add their names to a\n" +
		"file called `.chezmoiignore` in the source state.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Patterns are supported, and you can change what's ignored from machine to\n" +
		"machine. The full usage and syntax is described in the [reference\n" +
		"manual](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/REFERENCE.md#chezmoiignore).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## If the target already exists, but is \"behind\" the source, can chezmoi be configured to preserve the target version before replacing it with one derived from the source?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Yes. Run `chezmoi add` will update the source state with the target. To see\n" +
		"diffs of what would change, without actually changing anything, use `chezmoi\n" +
		"diff`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Once I've made a change to the source directory, how do I commit it?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"You have several options:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* `chezmoi cd` opens a shell in the source directory, where you can run your\n" +
		"  usual version control commands, like `git add` and `git commit`.\n" +
		"* `chezmoi git` and `chezmoi hg` run `git` and `hg` respectively in the source\n" +
		"  directory and pass extra arguments to the command. If you're passing any\n" +
		"  flags, you'll need to use `--` to prevent chezmoi from consuming them, for\n" +
		"  example `chezmoi git -- commit -m \"Update dotfiles\"`.\n" +
		"* `chezmoi source` runs your configured version control system in your source\n" +
		"  directory. It works in the same way as the `chezmoi git` and `chezmoi hg`\n" +
		"  commands, but uses `sourceVCS.command`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## How do I only run a script when a file has changed?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"A common example of this is that you're using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and\n" +
		"have `.Brewfile` listing all the packages that you want installed and only want\n" +
		"to run `brew bundle --global` when the contents of `.Brewfile` have changed.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi has two types of scripts: scripts that run every time, and scripts that\n" +
		"only run when their contents change. chezmoi does not have a mechanism to run a\n" +
		"script when an arbitrary file has changed, but there are some ways to achieve\n" +
		"the desired behavior:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"1. Have the script create `.Brewfile` instead of chezmoi, e.g. in your\n" +
		"   `run_once_install-packages`:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"   ```sh\n" +
		"   #!/bin/sh\n" +
		"\n" +
		"   cat > $HOME/.Brewfile <<EOF\n" +
		"   brew \"imagemagick\"\n" +
		"   brew \"openssl\"\n" +
		"   EOF\n" +
		"\n" +
		"   brew bundle --global\n" +
		"   ```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"2. Don't use `.Brewfile`, and instead install the packages explicitly in\n" +
		"   `run_once_install-packages`:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"   ```sh\n" +
		"   #!/bin/sh\n" +
		"\n" +
		"   brew install imagemagick || true\n" +
		"   brew install openssl || true\n" +
		"   ```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"   The `|| true` is necessary because `brew install` exits with failure if the\n" +
		"   package is already installed.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"3. Use a script that runs every time (not just once) and rely on `brew bundle\n" +
		"   --global` being idempotent.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"4. Use a script that runs every time, records a checksum of `.Brewfile` in\n" +
		"   another file, and only runs `brew bundle --global` if the checksum has\n" +
		"   changed, and updates the recorded checksum after.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## I've made changes to both the destination state and the source state that I want to keep. How can I keep them both?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`chezmoi merge` will open a merge tool to resolve differences between the source\n" +
		"state, target state, and destination state. Copy the changes you want to keep in\n" +
		"to the source state.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Why does chezmoi convert all my template variables to lowercase?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This is due to a feature in\n" +
		"[`github.com/spf13/viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper), the library that\n" +
		"chezmoi uses to read its configuration file. For more information see [this\n" +
		"GitHub issue](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/463).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## chezmoi makes `~/.ssh/config` group writeable. How do I stop this?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"By default, chezmoi uses your system's umask when creating files. On most\n" +
		"systems the default umask is `0022` but some systems use `0002`, which means\n" +
		"that files and directories are group writeable by default.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"You can override this for chezmoi by setting the `umask` configuration variable\n" +
		"in your configuration file, for example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    umask = 0022\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Note that this will apply to all files and directories that chezmoi manages and\n" +
		"will ensure that none of them are group writeable. It is not currently possible\n" +
		"to control group write permissions for individual files or directories. Please\n" +
		"[open an issue on\n" +
		"GitHub](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=02_feature_request.md&title=)\n" +
		"if you need this.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Can I change how chezmoi's source state is represented on disk?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"There are a number of criticisms of how chezmoi's source state is represented on\n" +
		"disk:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"1. The source file naming system cannot handle all possible filenames.\n" +
		"2. Not all possible file permissions can be represented.\n" +
		"3. The long source file names are verbose.\n" +
		"4. Everything is in a single directory, which can end up containing many entries.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi's source state representation is a deliberate, practical compromise.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Certain target filenames, for example `~/dot_example`, are incompatible with\n" +
		"chezmoi's\n" +
		"[attributes](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/REFERENCE.md#source-state-attributes)\n" +
		"used in the source state. In practice, dotfile filenames are unlikely to\n" +
		"conflict with chezmoi's attributes. If this does cause a genuine problem for\n" +
		"you, please [open an issue on\n" +
		"GitHub](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The `dot_` attribute makes it transparent which dotfiles are managed by chezmoi\n" +
		"and which files are ignored by chezmoi. chezmoi ignores all files and\n" +
		"directories that start with `.` so no special whitelists are needed for version\n" +
		"control systems and their control files (e.g. `.git` and `.gitignore`).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi needs per-file metadata to know how to interpret the source file's\n" +
		"contents, for example to know when the source file is a template or if the\n" +
		"file's contents are encrypted. By storing this metadata in the filename, the\n" +
		"metadata is unambiguously associated with a single file and adding, updating, or\n" +
		"removing a single file touches only a single file in the source state. Changes\n" +
		"to the metadata (e.g. `chezmoi chattr +template *target*`) are simple file\n" +
		"renames and isolated to the affected file.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If chezmoi were to, say, use a common configuration file listing which files\n" +
		"were templates and/or encrypted, then changes to any file would require updates\n" +
		"to the common configuration file. Automating updates to configuration files\n" +
		"requires a round trip (read config file, update config, write config) and it is\n" +
		"not always possible preserve comments and formatting.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi's attributes of `executable_` and `private_` only allow a the file\n" +
		"permissions `0o644`, `0o755`, `0o600`, and `0o700` to be represented.\n" +
		"Directories can only have permissions `0o755` or `0o700`. In practice, these\n" +
		"cover all permissions typically used for dotfiles. If this does cause a genuine\n" +
		"problem for you, please [open an issue on\n" +
		"GitHub](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"File permissions and modes like `executable_`, `private_`, and `symlink_` could\n" +
		"also be stored in the filesystem, rather than in the filename. However, this\n" +
		"requires the permissions to be preserved and handled by the underlying version\n" +
		"control system and filesystem. chezmoi provides first-class support for Windows,\n" +
		"where the `executable_` and `private_` attributes have no direct equivalents and\n" +
		"symbolic links are not always permitted. Some version control systems do not\n" +
		"preserve file permissions or handle symbolic links. By using regular files and\n" +
		"directories, chezmoi avoids variations in the operating system, version control\n" +
		"system, and filesystem making it both more robust and more portable.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi uses a 1:1 mapping between entries in the source state and entries in\n" +
		"the target state. This mapping is bi-directional and unambiguous.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"However, this also means that dotfiles that in the same directory in the target\n" +
		"state must be in the same directory in the source state. In particular, every\n" +
		"entry managed by chezmoi in the root of your home directory has a corresponding\n" +
		"entry in the root of your source directory, which can mean that you end up with\n" +
		"a lot of entries in the root of your source directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If chezmoi were to permit, say, multiple separate source directories (so you\n" +
		"could, say, put `dot_bashrc` in a `bash/` subdirectory, and `dot_vimrc` in a\n" +
		"`vim/` subdirectory, but have `chezmoi apply` map these to `~/.bashrc` and\n" +
		"`~/.vimrc` in the root of your home directory) then the mapping between source\n" +
		"and target states is no longer bidirectional nor unambiguous, which\n" +
		"significantly increases complexity and requires more user interaction. For\n" +
		"example, if both `bash/dot_bashrc` and `vim/dot_bashrc` exist, what should be\n" +
		"the contents of `~/.bashrc`? If you run `chezmoi add ~/.zshrc`, should\n" +
		"`dot_zshrc` be stored in the source `bash/` directory, the source `vim/`\n" +
		"directory, or somewhere else? How does the user communicate their preferences?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi has many users and any changes to the source state representation must\n" +
		"be backwards-compatible.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"In summary, chezmoi's source state representation is a compromise with both\n" +
		"advantages and disadvantages. Changes to the representation will be considered,\n" +
		"but must meet the following criteria, in order of importance:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"1. Be fully backwards-compatible for existing users.\n" +
		"2. Fix a genuine problem encountered in practice.\n" +
		"3. Be independent of the underlying operating system, version control system, and\n" +
		"  filesystem.\n" +
		"4. Not add significant extra complexity to the user interface or underlying\n" +
		"   implementation.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## gpg encryption fails. What could be wrong?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The `gpg.recipient` key should be ultimately trusted, otherwise encryption will\n" +
		"fail because gpg will prompt for input, which chezmoi does not handle. You can\n" +
		"check the trust level by running:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    gpg --export-ownertrust\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The trust level for the recipient's key should be `6`. If it is not, you can\n" +
		"change the trust level by running:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    gpg --edit-key $recipient\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Enter `trust` at the prompt and chose `5 = I trust ultimately`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## I'm getting errors trying to build chezmoi from source\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi requires Go version 1.13 or later and Go modules enabled. You can check\n" +
		"the version of Go with:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    go version\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Enable Go modules by setting `GO111MODULE=on` when running `go get`:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    GO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/twpayne/chezmoi\n" +
		"\n" +
		"For more details on building chezmoi, see the [Contributing\n" +
		"Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## What inspired chezmoi?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi was inspired by [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), but created because\n" +
		"Puppet is a slow overkill for managing your personal configuration files. The\n" +
		"focus of chezmoi will always be personal home directory management. If your\n" +
		"needs grow beyond that, switch to a whole system configuration management tool.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Why not use Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Salt, or similar to manage my dotfiles instead?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Whole system management tools are more than capable of managing your dotfiles,\n" +
		"but are large systems that entail several disadvantages. Compared to whole\n" +
		"system management tools, chezmoi offers:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* Small, focused feature set designed for dotfiles. There's simply less to learn\n" +
		"  with chezmoi compared to whole system management tools.\n" +
		"* Easy installation and execution on every platform, without root access.\n" +
		"  Installing chezmoi requires only copying a single binary file with no external\n" +
		"  dependencies. Executing chezmoi just involves running the binary. In contrast,\n" +
		"  installing and running a whole system management tools typically requires\n" +
		"  installing a scripting language runtime, several packages, and running a\n" +
		"  system service, all typically requiring root access.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi's focus and simple installation means that it runs almost everywhere:\n" +
		"from tiny ARM-based Linux systems to Windows desktops, from inside lightweight\n" +
		"containers to FreeBSD-based virtual machines in the cloud. \n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Can I use chezmoi to manage files outside my home directory?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"In practice, yes, you can, but this is strongly discouraged beyond using your\n" +
		"system's package manager to install the packages you need.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi is designed to operate on your home directory, and is explicitly not a\n" +
		"full system configuration management tool. That said, there are some ways to\n" +
		"have chezmoi manage a few files outside your home directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi's scripts can execute arbitrary commands, so you can use a `run_` script\n" +
		"that is run every time you run `chezmoi apply`, to, for example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* Make the target file outside your home directory a symlink to a file managed\n" +
		"  by chezmoi in your home directory.\n" +
		"* Copy a file managed by chezmoi inside your home directory to the target file.\n" +
		"* Execute a template with `chezmoi execute-template --output=filename template`\n" +
		"  where `filename` is outside the target directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi executes all scripts as the user executing chezmoi, so you may need to\n" +
		"add extra privilege elevation commands like `sudo` or `PowerShell start -verb\n" +
		"runas -wait` to your script.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi, by default, operates on your home directory but this can be overridden\n" +
		"with the `--destination` command line flag or by specifying `destDir` in your\n" +
		"config file, and could even be the root directory (`/` or `C:\\`). This allows\n" +
		"you, in theory, to use chezmoi to manage any file in your filesystem, but this\n" +
		"usage is extremely strongly discouraged.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If your needs extend beyond modifying a handful of files outside your target\n" +
		"system, then existing configuration management tools like\n" +
		"[Puppet](https://puppet.com/), [Chef](https://chef.io/),\n" +
		"[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and [Salt](https://www.saltstack.com/) are\n" +
		"much better suited - and of course can be called from a chezmoi `run_` script.\n" +
		"Put your Puppet Manifests, Chef Recipes, Ansible Modules, and Salt Modules in a\n" +
		"directory ignored by `.chezmoiignore` so they do not pollute your home\n" +
		"directory. \n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Where does the name \"chezmoi\" come from?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"\"chezmoi\" splits to \"chez moi\" and pronounced /ʃeɪ mwa/ (shay-moi) meaning \"at\n" +
		"my house\" in French. It's seven letters long, which is an appropriate length for\n" +
		"a command that is only run occasionally.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## What other questions have been asked about chezmoi?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"See the [issues on\n" +
		"GitHub](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Asupport).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Where do I ask a question that isn't answered here?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## I like chezmoi. How do I say thanks?\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Thank you! chezmoi was written to scratch a personal itch, and I'm very happy\n" +
		"that it's useful to you. Please give [chezmoi a star on\n" +

		"## Use a hosted repo to manage your dotfiles across multiple machines\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi relies on your version control system and hosted repo to share changes\n" +
		"across multiple machines. You should create a repo on the source code repository\n" +
		"of your choice (e.g. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org),\n" +
		"[GitHub](https://github.com/), or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), many people call\n" +
		"their repo `dotfiles`) and push the repo in the source directory here. For\n" +
		"example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi cd\n" +
		"    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git\n" +
		"    git push -u origin master\n" +
		"    exit\n" +
		"\n" +
		"On another machine you can checkout this repo:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi init https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git\n" +
		"\n" +
		"You can then see what would be changed:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi diff\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you're happy with the changes then apply them:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi apply\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The above commands can be combined into a single init, checkout, and apply:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi init --apply --verbose https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Pull the latest changes from your repo and apply them\n" +
		"\n" +
		"You can pull the changes from your repo and apply them in a single command:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi update\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This runs `git pull --rebase` in your source directory and then `chezmoi apply`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Pull the latest changes from your repo and see what would change, without actually applying the changes\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Run:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi source pull -- --rebase && chezmoi diff\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This runs `git pull --rebase` in your source directory and `chezmoi\n" +
		"diff` then shows the difference between the target state computed from your\n" +
		"source directory and the actual state.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you're happy with the changes, then you can run\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi apply\n" +
		"\n" +
		"to apply them.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Automatically commit and push changes to your repo\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi can automatically commit and push changes to your source directory to\n" +
		"your repo. This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, add the following\n" +
		"to your config file:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    [sourceVCS]\n" +
		"        autoCommit = true\n" +
		"        autoPush = true\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Whenever a change is made to your source directory, chezmoi will commit the\n" +
		"changes with an automatically-generated commit message (if `autoCommit` is true)\n" +
		"and push them to your repo (if `autoPush` is true). `autoPush` implies\n" +
		"`autoCommit`, i.e. if `autoPush` is true then chezmoi will auto-commit your\n" +
		"changes. If you only set `autoCommit` to true then changes will be committed but\n" +
		"not pushed.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Be careful when using `autoPush`. If your dotfiles repo is public and you\n" +
		"accidentally add a secret in plain text, that secret will be pushed to your\n" +
		"public repo.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Use templates to manage files that vary from machine to machine\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The primary goal of chezmoi is to manage configuration files across multiple\n" +
		"machines, for example your personal macOS laptop, your work Ubuntu desktop, and\n" +
		"your work Linux laptop. You will want to keep much configuration the same across\n" +
		"these, but also need machine-specific configurations for email addresses,\n" +
		"credentials, etc. chezmoi achieves this functionality by using\n" +
		"[`text/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) for the source state where\n" +
		"needed.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"For example, your home `~/.gitconfig` on your personal machine might look like:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    [user]\n" +
		"      email = \"john@home.org\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Whereas at work it might be:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    [user]\n" +
		"      email = \"john.smith@company.com\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"To handle this, on each machine create a configuration file called\n" +
		"`~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml` defining variables that might vary from machine\n" +
		"to machine. For example, for your home machine:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    [data]\n" +
		"      email = \"john@home.org\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Note that all variable names will be converted to lowercase. This is due to a\n" +
		"feature of a library used by chezmoi.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you intend to store private data (e.g. access tokens) in\n" +
		"`~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml`, make sure it has permissions `0600`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you prefer, you can use any format supported by\n" +
		"[Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for your configuration file. This\n" +
		"includes JSON, YAML, and TOML. Variable names must start with a letter and be\n" +
		"followed by zero or more letters or digits.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Then, add `~/.gitconfig` to chezmoi using the `--autotemplate` flag to turn it\n" +
		"into a template and automatically detect variables from the `data` section\n" +
		"of your `~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml` file:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi add --autotemplate ~/.gitconfig\n" +
		"\n" +
		"You can then open the template (which will be saved in the file\n" +
		"`~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_gitconfig.tmpl`):\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi edit ~/.gitconfig\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The file should look something like:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    [user]\n" +
		"      email = \"{{ .email }}\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"To disable automatic variable detection, use the `--template` or `-T` option to\n" +
		"`chezmoi add` instead of `--autotemplate`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Templates are often used to capture machine-specific differences. For example,\n" +
		"in your `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc.tmpl` you might have:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    # common config\n" +
		"    export EDITOR=vi\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    # machine-specific configuration\n" +
		"    {{- if eq .chezmoi.hostname \"work-laptop\" }}\n" +
		"    # this will only be included in ~/.bashrc on work-laptop\n" +
		"    {{- end }}\n" +
		"\n" +
		"For a full list of variables, run:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi data\n" +
		"\n" +
		"For more advanced usage, you can use the full power of the\n" +
		"[`text/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) language. chezmoi includes\n" +
		"all of the text functions from [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) and\n" +
		"its own [functions for interacting with password\n" +
		"managers](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/REFERENCE.md#template-functions).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Templates can be executed directly from the command line, without the need to\n" +
		"create a file on disk, with the `execute-template` command, for example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi execute-template '{{ .chezmoi.os }}/{{ .chezmoi.arch }}'\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This is useful when developing or debugging templates.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Some password managers allow you to store complete files. The files can be\n" +
		"retrieved with chezmoi's template functions. For example, if you have a file\n" +
		"stored in 1Password with the UUID `uuid` then you can retrieve it with the\n" +
		"template:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    {{- onepasswordDocument \"uuid\" -}}\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The `-`s inside the brackets remove any whitespace before or after the template\n" +
		"expression, which is useful if your editor has added any newlines.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If, after executing the template, the file contents are empty, the target file\n" +
		"will be removed. This can be used to ensure that files are only present on\n" +
		"certain machines. If you want an empty file to be created anyway, you will need\n" +
		"to give it an `empty_` prefix.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"For coarser-grained control of files and entire directories managed on different\n" +
		"machines, or to exclude certain files completely, you can create\n" +
		"`.chezmoiignore` files in the source directory. These specify a list of patterns\n" +
		"that chezmoi should ignore, and are interpreted as templates. An example\n" +
		"`.chezmoiignore` file might look like:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    README.md\n" +
		"    {{- if ne .chezmoi.hostname \"work-laptop\" }}\n" +
		"    .work # only manage .work on work-laptop\n" +
		"    {{- end }}\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The use of `ne` (not equal) is deliberate. What we want to achieve is \"only\n" +
		"install `.work` if hostname is `work-laptop`\" but chezmoi installs everything by\n" +
		"default, so we have to turn the logic around and instead write \"ignore `.work`\n" +
		"unless the hostname is `work-laptop`\".\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Patterns can be excluded by prefixing them with a `!`, for example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    f*\n" +
		"    !foo\n" +
		"\n" +
		"will ignore all files beginning with an `f` except `foo`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Use completely separate config files on different machines\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi's template functionality allows you to change a file's contents based on\n" +
		"any variable. For example, if you want `~/.bashrc` to be different on Linux and\n" +
		"macOS you would create a file in the source state called `dot_bashrc.tmpl`\n" +
		"containing:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"{{ if eq .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" -}}\n" +
		"# macOS .bashrc contents\n" +
		"{{ else if eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\" -}}\n" +
		"# Linux .bashrc contents\n" +
		"{{ end -}}\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"However, if the differences between the two versions are so large that you'd\n" +
		"prefer to use completely separate files in the source state, you can achieve\n" +
		"this using a symbolic link template. Create the following files:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`symlink_dot_bashrc.tmpl`:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		".bashrc_{{ .chezmoi.os }}\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`dot_bashrc_darwin`:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"# macOS .bashrc contents\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`dot_bashrc_linux`:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"# Linux .bashrc contents\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`.chezmoiignore`\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"{{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" }}\n" +
		".bashrc_darwin\n" +
		"{{ end }}\n" +
		"{{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"linux\" }}\n" +
		".bashrc_linux\n" +
		"{{ end }}\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This will make `~/.bashrc` will be a symlink to `.bashrc_darwin` on `darwin` and\n" +
		"to `.bashrc_linux`. The `.chezmoiignore` configuration ensures that only the\n" +
		"OS-specific `.bashrc_os` file will be installed on each OS.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Create a config file on a new machine automatically\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`chezmoi init` can also create a config file automatically, if one does not\n" +
		"already exist. If your repo contains a file called `.chezmoi.<format>.tmpl`\n" +
		"where *format* is one of the supported config file formats (e.g. `json`, `toml`,\n" +
		"or `yaml`) then `chezmoi init` will execute that template to generate your\n" +
		"initial config file.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Specifically, if you have `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` that looks like this:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    {{- $email := promptString \"email\" -}}\n" +
		"    [data]\n" +
		"        email = \"{{ $email }}\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Then `chezmoi init` will create an initial `chezmoi.toml` using this template.\n" +
		"`promptString` is a special function that prompts the user (you) for a value.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"To test this template, use `chezmoi execute-template` with the `--init` and\n" +
		"`--promptString` flags, for example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi execute-template --init --promptString email=john@home.org < ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoi.toml.tmpl\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Have chezmoi create a directory, but ignore its contents\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you want chezmoi to create a directory, but ignore its contents, say `~/src`,\n" +
		"first run:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    mkdir -p $(chezmoi source-path)/src\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This creates the directory in the source state, which means that chezmoi will\n" +
		"create it (if it does not already exist) when you run `chezmoi apply`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"However, as this is an empty directory it will be ignored by git. So, create a\n" +
		"file in the directory in the source state that will be seen by git (so git does\n" +
		"not ignore the directory) but ignored by chezmoi (so chezmoi does not include it\n" +
		"in the target state):\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    touch $(chezmoi source-path)/src/.keep\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi automatically creates `.keep` files when you add an empty directory with\n" +
		"`chezmoi add`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Ensure that a target is removed\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Create a file called `.chezmoiremove` in the source directory containing a list\n" +
		"of patterns of files to remove. When you run\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi apply --remove\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi will remove anything in the target directory that matches the pattern.\n" +
		"As this command is potentially dangerous, you should run chezmoi in verbose,\n" +
		"dry-run mode beforehand to see what would be removed:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi apply --remove --dry-run --verbose\n" +
		"\n" +
		"`.chezmoiremove` is interpreted as a template, so you can remove different files\n" +
		"on different machines. Negative matches (patterns prefixed with a `!`) or\n" +
		"targets listed in `.chezmoiignore` will never be removed.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Include a subdirectory from another repository, like Oh My Zsh\n" +
		"\n" +
		"To include a subdirectory from another repository, e.g. [Oh My\n" +
		"Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), you cannot use git submodules\n" +
		"because chezmoi uses its own format for the source state and Oh My Zsh is not\n" +
		"distributed in this format. Instead, you can use the `import` command to import\n" +
		"a snapshot from a tarball:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    curl -s -L -o oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/archive/master.tar.gz\n" +
		"    chezmoi import --strip-components 1 --destination ${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Add `oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz` to `.chezmoiignore` if you run these commands in\n" +
		"your source directory so that chezmoi doesn't try to copy the tarball anywhere.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Disable Oh My Zsh auto-updates by setting `DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=\"true\"` in\n" +
		"`~/.zshrc`. Auto updates will cause the `~/.oh-my-zsh` directory to drift out of\n" +
		"sync with chezmoi's source state. To update Oh My Zsh, re-run the `curl` and\n" +
		"`chezmoi import` commands above.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Handle configuration files which are externally modified\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Some programs modify their configuration files. When you next run `chezmoi\n" +
		"apply`, any modifications made by the program will be lost.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"You can track changes to these files by replacing with a symlink back to a file\n" +
		"in your source directory, which is under version control. Here is a worked\n" +
		"example for VSCode's `settings.json` on Linux:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Copy the configuration file to your source directory:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    cp ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json $(chezmoi source-path)\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Tell chezmoi to ignore this file:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    echo settings.json >> $(chezmoi source-path)/.chezmoiignore\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Tell chezmoi that `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json` should be a symlink to the\n" +
		"file in your source directory:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    mkdir -p $(chezmoi source-path)/private_dot_config/private_Code/User\n" +
		"    echo -n \"{{ .chezmoi.sourceDir }}/settings.json\" > $(chezmoi source-path)/private_dot_config/private_Code/User/symlink_settings.json.tmpl\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The prefix `private_` is used because the `~/.config` and `~/.config/Code`\n" +
		"directories are private by default.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Apply the changes:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi apply -v\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Now, when the program modifies its configuration file it will modify the file in\n" +
		"the source state instead.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Handle different file locations on different systems with the same contents\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you want to have the same file contents in different locations on different\n" +
		"systems, but maintain only a single file in your source state, you can use\n" +
		"a shared template.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Create the common file in the `.chezmoitemplates` directory in the source state. For\n" +
		"example, create `.chezmoitemplates/file.conf`. The contents of this file are\n" +
		"available in templates with the `template *name*` function where *name* is the\n" +
		"name of the file.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Then create files for each system, for example `Library/Application\n" +
		"Support/App/file.conf.tmpl` for macOS and `dot_config/app/file.conf.tmpl` for\n" +
		"Linux. Both template files should contain `{{- template \"file.conf\" -}}`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Finally, tell chezmoi to ignore files where they are not needed by adding lines\n" +
		"to your `.chezmoiignore` file, for example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"{{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" }}\n" +
		"Library/Application Support/App/file.conf\n" +
		"{{ end }}\n" +
		"{{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"linux\" }}\n" +
		".config/app/file.conf\n" +
		"{{ end }}\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Keep data private\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi automatically detects when files and directories are private when adding\n" +
		"them by inspecting their permissions. Private files and directories are stored\n" +
		"in `~/.local/share/chezmoi` as regular, public files with permissions `0644` and\n" +
		"the name prefix `private_`. For example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi add ~/.netrc\n" +
		"\n" +
		"will create `~/.local/share/chezmoi/private_dot_netrc` (assuming `~/.netrc` is\n" +
		"not world- or group- readable, as it should be). This file is still private\n" +
		"because `~/.local/share/chezmoi` is not group- or world- readable or executable.\n" +
		"chezmoi checks that the permissions of `~/.local/share/chezmoi` are `0700` on\n" +
		"every run and will print a warning if they are not.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"It is common that you need to store access tokens in config files, e.g. a\n" +
		"[GitHub access\n" +
		"token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).\n" +
		"There are several ways to keep these tokens secure, and to prevent them leaving\n" +
		"your machine.\n" +
		"\n" +

		"\n" +
		"### Use templates variables to keep your secrets\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Typically, `~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml` is not checked in to version control\n" +
		"and has permissions 0600. You can store tokens as template values in the `data`\n" +
		"section. For example, if your `~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml` contains:\n" +

		"## Use scripts to perform actions\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### Understand how scripts work\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi supports scripts, which are executed when you run `chezmoi apply`. The\n" +
		"scripts can either run every time you run `chezmoi apply`, or only when their\n" +
		"contents have changed.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"In verbose mode, the script's contents will be printed before executing it. In\n" +
		"dry-run mode, the script is not executed.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Scripts are any file in the source directory with the prefix `run_`, and are\n" +
		"executed in alphabetical order. Scripts that should only be run when their\n" +
		"contents change have the prefix `run_once_`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Scripts break chezmoi's declarative approach, and as such should be used\n" +
		"sparingly. Any script should be idempotent, even `run_once_` scripts.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Scripts must be created manually in the source directory, typically by running\n" +
		"`chezmoi cd` and then creating a file with a `run_` prefix. Scripts are executed\n" +
		"directly using `exec` and must include a shebang line or be executable binaries.\n" +
		"There is no need to set the executable bit on the script.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Scripts with the suffix `.tmpl` are treated as templates, with the usual\n" +
		"template variables available. If, after executing the template, the result is\n" +
		"only whitespace or an empty string, then the script is not executed. This is\n" +
		"useful for disabling scripts.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### Install packages with scripts\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Change to the source directory and create a file called\n" +
		"`run_once_install-packages.sh`:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi cd\n" +
		"    $EDITOR run_once_install-packages.sh\n" +
		"\n" +
		"In this file create your package installation script, e.g.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    #!/bin/sh\n" +
		"    sudo apt install ripgrep\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The next time you run `chezmoi apply` or `chezmoi update` this script will be\n" +
		"run. As it has the `run_once_` prefix, it will not be run again unless its\n" +
		"contents change, for example if you add more packages to be installed.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This script can also be a template. For example, if you create\n" +
		"`run_once_install-packages.sh.tmpl` with the contents:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    {{ if eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\" -}}\n" +
		"    #!/bin/sh\n" +
		"    sudo apt install ripgrep\n" +
		"    {{ else if eq .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" -}}\n" +
		"    #!/bin/sh\n" +
		"    brew install ripgrep\n" +

		"You can use chezmoi to manage your dotfiles in [GitHub\n" +
		"Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account),\n" +
		"[Visual Studio\n" +
		"Codespaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en/visualstudio/codespaces/reference/personalizing),\n" +
		"and [Visual Studio Code Remote -\n" +
		"Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_personalizing-with-dotfile-repositories).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"For a quick start, you can clone the [`chezmoi/dotfiles`\n" +
		"repository](https://github.com/chezmoi/dotfiles) which supports Codespaces out\n" +
		"of the box.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The workflow is different to using chezmoi on a new machine, notably:\n" +
		"* These systems will automatically clone your `dotfiles` repo to `~/dotfiles`,\n" +
		"  so there is no need to clone your repo yourself.\n" +
		"* The installation script must be non-interactive.\n" +
		"* When running in a Codespace, the environment variable `CODESPACES` will be set\n" +
		"  to `true`. You can read its value with the [`env` template\n" +
		"  function](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/os.html).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"First, if you are using a chezmoi configuration file template, ensure that it is\n" +
		"non-interactive when running in codespaces, for example, `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl`\n" +
		"might contain:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"{{- $codespaces:= env \"CODESPACES\" | not | not -}}\n" +
		"sourceDir = \"{{ .chezmoi.sourceDir }}\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"[data]\n" +
		"  name = \"Your name\"\n" +
		"  codespaces = {{ $codespaces }}\n" +
		"{{- if $codespaces }}{{/* Codespaces dotfiles setup is non-interactive, so set an email address */}}\n" +
		"  email = \"your@email.com\"\n" +
		"{{- else }}{{/* Interactive setup, so prompt for an email address */}}\n" +
		"  email = \"{{ promptString \"email\" }}\"\n" +
		"{{- end }}\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This sets the `codespaces` template variable, so you don't have to repeat `(env\n" +
		"\"CODESPACES\")` in your templates. It also sets the `sourceDir` configuration to\n" +
		"the `--source` argument passed in `chezmoi init`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Second, create an `install.sh` script that installs chezmoi and your dotfiles:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```sh\n" +
		"#!/bin/sh\n" +
		"\n" +
		"set -e # -e: exit on error\n" +
		"\n" +

		"    sh -c \"$(wget -qO- https://git.io/chezmoi)\" -- -b \"$bin_dir\"\n" +
		"  else\n" +

		"exec \"$chezmoi\" init --apply \"--source=$script_dir\"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Ensure that this file is executable (`chmod a+x install.sh`), and add\n" +
		"`install.sh` to your `.chezmoiignore` file.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"It installs the latest version of chezmoi in `~/.local/bin` if needed, and then\n" +
		"`chezmoi init ...` invokes chezmoi to create its configuration file and\n" +
		"initialize your dotfiles. `--apply` tells chezmoi to apply the changes\n" +
		"immediately, and `--source=...` tells chezmoi where to find the cloned\n" +
		"`dotfiles` repo, which in this case is the same folder in which the script is\n" +
		"running from.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If you do not use a chezmoi configuration file template you can use `chezmoi\n" +
		"apply --source=$HOME/dotfiles` instead of `chezmoi init ...` in `install.sh`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Finally, modify any of your templates to use the `codespaces` variable if\n" +
		"needed. For example, to install `vim-gtk` on Linux but not in Codespaces, your\n" +
		"`run_once_install-packages.sh.tmpl` might contain:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"{{- if (and (eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\")) (not .codespaces))) -}}\n" +
		"#!/bin/sh\n" +
		"sudo apt install -y vim-gtk\n" +
		"{{- end -}}\n" +
		"```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Detect Windows Services for Linux (WSL)\n" +
		"\n" +
		"WSL can be detected by looking for the string `Microsoft` in\n" +

		"`.chezmoi.kernel.osrelease`, for example:\n" +

		"\n" +
		"## Import archives\n" +
		"\n" +
		"It is occasionally useful to import entire archives of configuration into your\n" +
		"source state. The `import` command does this. For example, to import the latest\n" +
		"version\n" +
		"[`github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)\n" +
		"to `~/.oh-my-zsh` run:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    curl -s -L -o oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/archive/master.tar.gz\n" +
		"    chezmoi import --strip-components 1 --destination ~/.oh-my-zsh oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Note that this only updates the source state. You will need to run\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi apply\n" +
		"\n" +
		"to update your destination directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Export archives\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi can create an archive containing the target state. This can be useful\n" +
		"for generating target state on a different machine or for simply inspecting the\n" +
		"target state. A particularly useful command is:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi archive | tar tvf -\n" +
		"\n" +
		"which lists all the targets in the target state.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Use a non-git version control system\n" +
		"\n" +
		"By default, chezmoi uses git, but you can use any version control system of your\n" +
		"choice. In your config file, specify the command to use. For example, to use\n" +
		"Mercurial specify:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    [sourceVCS]\n" +
		"      command = \"hg\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The source VCS command is used in the chezmoi commands `init`, `source`, and\n" +
		"`update`, and support for VCSes other than git is limited but easy to add. If\n" +
		"you'd like to see your VCS better supported, please [open an issue on\n" +
		"GitHub](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose).\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Customize the `diff` command\n" +
		"\n" +
		"By default, chezmoi uses a built-in diff. You can change the format, and/or pipe\n" +
		"the output into a pager of your choice. For example, to use\n" +
		"[`diff-so-fancy`](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) specify:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    [diff]\n" +
		"        format = \"git\"\n" +
		"        pager = \"diff-so-fancy\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"The format can also be set with the `--format` option to the `diff` command, and\n" +
		"the pager can be disabled using `--no-pager`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Use a merge tool other than vimdiff\n" +
		"\n" +
		"By default, chezmoi uses vimdiff, but you can use any merge tool of your choice.\n" +
		"In your config file, specify the command and args to use. For example, to use\n" +
		"neovim's diff mode specify:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    [merge]\n" +
		"      command = \"nvim\"\n" +
		"      args = \"-d\"\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Migrate from a dotfile manager that uses symlinks\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Many dotfile managers replace dotfiles with symbolic links to files in a common\n" +
		"directory. If you `chezmoi add` such a symlink, chezmoi will add the symlink,\n" +
		"not the file. To assist with migrating from symlink-based systems, use the\n" +
		"`--follow` option to `chezmoi add`, for example:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi add --follow ~/.bashrc\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This will tell `chezmoi add` that the target state of `~/.bashrc` is the target\n" +
		"of the `~/.bashrc` symlink, rather than the symlink itself. When you run\n" +
		"`chezmoi apply`, chezmoi will replace the `~/.bashrc` symlink with the file\n" +
		"contents.\n" +

		"\n" +
		"chezmoi stores the desired state of your dotfiles in the directory\n" +
		"`~/.local/share/chezmoi`. When you run `chezmoi apply`, chezmoi calculates the\n" +
		"desired contents and permissions for each dotfile and then makes any changes\n" +
		"necessary so that your dotfiles match that state.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Start using chezmoi on your current machine\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Initialize chezmoi:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi init\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This will create a new git repository in `~/.local/share/chezmoi` with\n" +
		"permissions `0700` where chezmoi will store the source state.  chezmoi only\n" +
		"modifies files in the working copy. It is your responsibility to commit changes.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Manage an existing file with chezmoi:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi add ~/.bashrc\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This will copy `~/.bashrc` to `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc`. If you want\n" +
		"to add a whole folder to chezmoi, you have to add the `-r` argument after `add`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Edit the source state:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi edit ~/.bashrc\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This will open `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc` in your `$EDITOR`. Make some\n" +
		"changes and save them.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"See what changes chezmoi would make:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi diff\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Apply the changes:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi -v apply\n" +
		"\n" +
		"All chezmoi commands accept the `-v` (verbose) flag to print out exactly what\n" +
		"changes they will make to the file system, and the `-n` (dry run) flag to not\n" +
		"make any actual changes. The combination `-n` `-v` is very useful if you want to\n" +
		"see exactly what changes would be made.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Finally, open a shell in the source directory, commit your changes, and return\n" +
		"to where you were:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi cd\n" +
		"    git add dot_bashrc\n" +
		"    git commit -m \"Add .bashrc\"\n" +
		"    exit\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Using chezmoi across multiple machines\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Clone the git repo in `~/.local/share/chezmoi` to a hosted Git service, e.g.\n" +
		"[GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or\n" +
		"[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org). Many people call their dotfiles repo\n" +
		"`dotfiles`. You can then setup chezmoi on a second machine:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi init https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git\n" +
		"\n" +
		"This will check out the repo and any submodules and optionally create a chezmoi\n" +
		"config file for you. It won't make any changes to your home directory until you\n" +
		"run:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi apply\n" +
		"\n" +
		"On any machine, you can pull and apply the latest changes from your repo with:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi update\n" +
		"\n" +
		"## Next steps\n" +
		"\n" +
		"For a full list of commands run:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"    chezmoi help\n" +
		"\n" +
		"chezmoi has much more functionality. Read the [how-to\n" +
		"guide](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/HOWTO.md) to explore.\n" +

		"chezmoi evaluates the source state for the current machine and then updates the\n" +
		"destination directory, where:\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The *source state* declares the desired state of your home directory,\n" +
		"  including templates and machine-specific configuration.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The *source directory* is where chezmoi stores the source state, by default\n" +
		"  `~/.local/share/chezmoi`.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The *target state* is the source state computed for the current machine.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The *destination directory* is the directory that chezmoi manages, by default\n" +
		"  `~`, your home directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* A *target* is a file, directory, or symlink in the destination directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The *destination state* is the current state of all the targets in the\n" +
		"  destination directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"* The *config file* contains machine-specific configuration, by default it is\n" +
		"  `~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml`.\n" +

		"## Global command line flags\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Command line flags override any values set in the configuration file.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### `--color` *value*\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Colorize diffs, *value* can be `on`, `off`, `auto`, or any boolean-like value\n" +
		"recognized by\n" +
		"[`strconv.ParseBool`](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv?tab=doc#ParseBool). The default\n" +
		"value is `auto` which will colorize diffs only if the the environment variable\n" +
		"`NO_COLOR` is not set and stdout is a terminal.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### `-c`, `--config` *filename*\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Read the configuration from *filename*.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### `--debug`\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Log information helpful for debugging.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### `-D`, `--destination` *directory*\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Use *directory* as the destination directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### `--follow`\n" +
		"\n" +
		"If the last part of a target is a symlink, deal with what the symlink\n" +
		"references, rather than the symlink itself.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### `-n`, `--dry-run`\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Set dry run mode. In dry run mode, the destination directory is never modified.\n" +

		"Use *directory* as the source directory.\n" +
		"\n" +
		"### `-v`, `--verbose`\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Set verbose mode. In verbose mode, chezmoi prints the changes that it is making\n" +
		"as approximate shell commands, and any differences in files between the target\n" +
