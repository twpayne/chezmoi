Very few, if any, changes should be required to your source directory, templates, or config file.\nNew features in version 2 #   The new chezmoi status command shows you a concise list of differences, much like git status. The chezmoi apply command prompts you if a file has been modified by something other than chezmoi since chezmoi last wrote it, keeping you in full control of your changes, wherever you make them. The chezmoi init command will try to guess your dotfile repository if you give it a short argument. For example, chezmoi init username is the equivalent of chezmoi init https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git. chezmoi includes a builtin git command which it will use if it cannot find git in your $PATH. This means that you don\u0026rsquo;t even have to install git to setup your dotfiles on a new machine. chezmoi detects when your config file template has changed and prompts you to re-run chezmoi init if needed. The new create_ attribute allows you to create a file with initial content, but not have it overwritten by chezmoi apply. The new modify_ attribute allows you to modify an existing file with a script, so you can use chezmoi to manage parts, but not all, of a file. The new script attributes before_ and after_ control when scripts are run relative to when your files are updated. The new --exclude option allows you to control what types of target will be updated. For example chezmoi apply --exclude=scripts will cause chezmoi to apply everything except scripts and chezmoi init --apply --exclude=encrypted will exclude encrypted files. The new --keep-going option causes chezmoi to keep going as far as possible rather than stopping at the first error it encounters. The new --no-tty option stops chezmoi from opening a TTY to read input (including passwords) and instead reads them from stdin. The new --source-path option allows you to specify targets by source path, which you can use in an on-save editor hook to automatically run chezmoi apply when you edit a dotfile in your source state. The new gitHubKeys template function allows you to populate your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys from your public SSH keys on GitHub. The promptBool function now also recognizes y, yes, on, n, no, and off as boolean values. The chezmoi archive command now includes scripts in the generated archive, and can generate .zip files. The new edit.command and edit.args configuration variables give you more control over the command invoked by chezmoi edit. The chezmoi init command has a new --one-shot option which does a shallow clone of your dotfiles repo, runs chezmoi apply, and then removes your source and configuration directories. It\u0026rsquo;s the fastest way to set up your dotfiles on a ephemeral machine and then remove all traces of chezmoi. Standard template variables are set on a best-effort basis. If errors are encountered, chezmoi leaves the variable unset rather than terminating with the error. The new .chezmoi.version template variable contains the version of chezmoi. You can compare versions using version comparison functions. The new .chezmoi.fqdnHostname template variables contains the fully-qualified domain name of the machine, if it can be determined. You can now encrypt whole files with age.  Changes from version 1 #  chezmoi version 2 includes a few minor changes from version 1, mainly to enable the new functionality and for consistency:\n chezmoi uses a different format to persist its state. Specifically, this means that all your run_once_ scripts will be run again the first time you run chezmoi apply. chezmoi add, and many other commands, are now recursive by default. chezmoi apply will warn if a file in the destination directory has been modified since chezmoi last wrote it. To force overwriting, pass the --force option. chezmoi edit no longer supports the --prompt option. The only diff format is now git. The diff.format configuration variable is ignored. Diffs include the contents of scripts that would be run. Mercurial support has been removed. The chezmoi source command has been removed, use chezmoi git instead. The sourceVCS configuration group has been renamed to git. The order of files for a three-way merge passed to merge.command is now actual file, target state, source state. The chezmoi keyring command has been moved to chezmoi secret keyring. The genericSecret configuration group has been renamed to secret. The chezmoi chattr command uses encrypted instead of encrypt as the attribute for encrypted files. The gpg recipient is configured with the gpg.recipient configuration variable, gpgRecipient is no longer used. The structure of data output by chezmoi dump has changed. The .chezmoi.homedir template variable has been replaced with .chezmoi.homeDir. For compatibility, .chezmoi.homedir will continue to be supported until version 2.1. The .chezmoi.fullHostname template variable has been removed, as it did not contain the full hostname. Use .chezmoi.fqdnHostname (UNIX only) instead.

In the same way that nobody would use an editor without an undo command, or develop software without a version control system, chezmoi brings the investment that you have made in mastering your tools to every environment that you work in.\nI already have a system to manage my dotfiles, why should I use chezmoi? #   Regular reminder that chezmoi is the best dotfile manager utility I\u0026rsquo;ve used and you can too\n— @mbbroberg\n If you\u0026rsquo;re using any of the following methods:\n A custom shell script. An existing dotfile manager like dotbot, rcm, homesick, yadm, or GNU Stow. A bare git repo.  Then you\u0026rsquo;ve probably run into at least one of the following problems.\nCoping with differences between machines requires extra effort #  If you want to synchronize your dotfiles across multiple operating systems or distributions, then you may need to manually perform extra steps to cope with differences from machine to machine. You might need to run different commands on different machines, maintain separate per-machine files or branches (with the associated hassle of merging, rebasing, or copying each change), or hope that your custom logic handles the differences correctly.\nchezmoi uses a single source of truth (a single branch) and a single command that works on every machine. Individual files can be templates to handle machine to machine differences, if needed.\nYou have to keep your dotfiles repo private #   And regarding dotfiles, I saw that. It\u0026rsquo;s only public dotfiles repos so I have to evaluate my dotfiles history to be sure. I have secrets scanning and more, but it was easier to keep it private for security, I\u0026rsquo;m ok mostly though. I\u0026rsquo;m using chezmoi and it\u0026rsquo;s easier now\n— @sheldon_hull\n If your system stores secrets in plain text, then you must be very careful about where you clone your dotfiles. If you clone them on your work machine then anyone with access to your work machine (e.g. your IT department) will have access to your home secrets. If you clone it on your home machine then you risk leaking work secrets.\nWith chezmoi you can store secrets in your password manager or encrypt them, and even store passwords in different ways on different machines. You can clone your dotfiles repository anywhere, and even make your dotfiles repo public, without leaving personal secrets on your work machine or work secrets on your personal machine.\nYou have to maintain your own tool #   I\u0026rsquo;ve offloaded my dotfiles deployment from a homespun shell script to chezmoi. I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with this decision.\n— @gotgenes\n  I discovered chezmoi and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, just migrated my old custom multi-machine sync dotfile setup and it\u0026rsquo;s so much simpler now\nin case you\u0026rsquo;re wondering I have written 0 code\n— @buritica\n If your system was written by you for your personal use, then it probably has the functionality that you needed when you wrote it. If you need more functionality then you have to implement it yourself.\nchezmoi includes a huge range of battle-tested functionality out-of-the-box, including dry-run and diff modes, script execution, conflict resolution, Windows support, and much, much more. chezmoi is used by thousands of people and has a rich suite of both unit and integration tests. When you hit the limits of your existing dotfile management system, chezmoi already has a tried-and-tested solution ready for you to use.\nSetting up your dotfiles requires more than two short commands #  If your system is written in a scripting language like Python, Perl, or Ruby, then you also need to install a compatible version of that language\u0026rsquo;s runtime before you can use your system.\nchezmoi is distributed as a single stand-alone statically-linked binary with no dependencies that you can simply copy onto your machine and run. chezmoi provides one-line installs, pre-built binaries, packages for Linux and BSD distributions, Homebrew formulae, Scoop and Chocolatey support on Windows, and a initial config file generation mechanism to make installing your dotfiles on a new machine as painless as possible.\n"}),a.add({id:2,href:'/docs/contributing/',title:"Contributing",section:"Docs",content:"Contributing Guide #  Getting started #  chezmoi is written in Go and development happens on GitHub.

If my .zshrc is managed by chezmoi and I edit ~/.zshrc without using chezmoi edit, what happens? #  Until you run chezmoi apply your modified ~/.zshrc will remain in place. When you run chezmoi apply chezmoi will detect that ~/.zshrc has changed since chezmoi last wrote it and prompt you what to do. You can resolve differences with a merge tool by running chezmoi merge ~/.zshrc.\nHow can I tell what dotfiles in my home directory aren\u0026rsquo;t managed by chezmoi? Is there an easy way to have chezmoi manage a subset of them? #  chezmoi unmanaged will list everything not managed by chezmoi. You can add entire directories with chezmoi add.\nHow can I tell what dotfiles in my home directory are currently managed by chezmoi? #  chezmoi managed will list everything managed by chezmoi.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s a mechanism in place for the above, is there also a way to tell chezmoi to ignore specific files or groups of files (e.g. by directory name or by glob)? #  By default, chezmoi ignores everything that you haven\u0026rsquo;t explicitly added. If you have files in your source directory that you don\u0026rsquo;t want added to your destination directory when you run chezmoi apply add their names to a file called .chezmoiignore in the source state.\nPatterns are supported, and you can change what\u0026rsquo;s ignored from machine to machine. The full usage and syntax is described in the reference manual.\nIf the target already exists, but is \u0026ldquo;behind\u0026rdquo; the source, can chezmoi be configured to preserve the target version before replacing it with one derived from the source? #  Yes. Run chezmoi add will update the source state with the target. To see diffs of what would change, without actually changing anything, use chezmoi diff.\nOnce I\u0026rsquo;ve made a change to the source directory, how do I commit it? #  You have several options:\n chezmoi cd opens a shell in the source directory, where you can run your usual version control commands, like git add and git commit. chezmoi git runs git in the source directory and pass extra arguments to the command. If you\u0026rsquo;re passing any flags, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use -- to prevent chezmoi from consuming them, for example chezmoi git -- commit -m \u0026quot;Update dotfiles\u0026quot;. You can configure chezmoi to automatically commit and push changes to your source state, as described in the how-to guide.  How do I only run a script when a file has changed? #  A common example of this is that you\u0026rsquo;re using Homebrew and have .Brewfile listing all the packages that you want installed and only want to run brew bundle --global when the contents of .Brewfile have changed.\nchezmoi has two types of scripts: scripts that run every time, and scripts that only run when their contents change. chezmoi does not have a mechanism to run a script when an arbitrary file has changed, but there are some ways to achieve the desired behavior:\n  Have the script create .Brewfile instead of chezmoi, e.g. in your run_once_install-packages:\n#!/bin/sh  cat \u0026gt; $HOME/.Brewfile \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF brew \u0026#34;imagemagick\u0026#34; brew \u0026#34;openssl\u0026#34; EOF brew bundle --global   Don\u0026rsquo;t use .Brewfile, and instead install the packages explicitly in run_once_install-packages:\n#!/bin/sh  brew install imagemagick || true brew install openssl || true The || true is necessary because brew install exits with failure if the package is already installed.\n  Use a script that runs every time (not just once) and rely on brew bundle --global being idempotent.\n  Use a script that runs every time, records a checksum of .Brewfile in another file, and only runs brew bundle --global if the checksum has changed, and updates the recorded checksum after.\n  I\u0026rsquo;ve made changes to both the destination state and the source state that I want to keep. How can I keep them both? #  chezmoi merge will open a merge tool to resolve differences between the source state, target state, and destination state. Copy the changes you want to keep in to the source state.\nWhy does chezmoi convert all my template variables to lowercase? #  This is due to a feature in github.com/spf13/viper, the library that chezmoi uses to read its configuration file. For more information see this GitHub issue.\nchezmoi makes ~/.ssh/config group writeable. How do I stop this? #  By default, chezmoi uses your system\u0026rsquo;s umask when creating files. On most systems the default umask is 022 but some systems use 002, which means that files and directories are group writeable by default.\nYou can override this for chezmoi by setting the umask configuration variable in your configuration file, for example:\numask = 0o022  Note that this will apply to all files and directories that chezmoi manages and will ensure that none of them are group writeable. It is not currently possible to control group write permissions for individual files or directories. Please open an issue on GitHub if you need this.\nWhy doesn\u0026rsquo;t chezmoi use symlinks like GNU Stow? #  Symlinks are first class citizens in chezmoi: chezmoi supports creating them, updating them, removing them, and even more advanced features not found elsewhere like having the same symlink point to different targets on different machines by using templates.\nWith chezmoi, you only use a symlink where you really want a symlink, in contrast to some other dotfile managers (e.g. GNU Stow) which require the use of symlinks as a layer of indirection between a dotfile\u0026rsquo;s location (which can be anywhere in your home directory) and a dotfile\u0026rsquo;s content (which needs to be in a centralized directory that you manage with version control). chezmoi solves this problem in a different way.\nInstead of using a symlink to redirect from the dotfile\u0026rsquo;s location to the centralized directory, chezmoi generates the dotfile in its final location from the contents of the centralized directory. Not only is no symlink is needed, this has the advantages that chezmoi is better able to cope with differences from machine to machine (as a dotfile\u0026rsquo;s contents can be unique to that machine) and the dotfiles that chezmoi creates are just regular files. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing special about dotfiles managed by chezmoi, whereas dotfiles managed with GNU Stow are special because they\u0026rsquo;re actually symlinks to somewhere else.\nThe only advantage to using GNU Stow-style symlinks is that changes that you make to the dotfile\u0026rsquo;s contents in the centralized directory are immediately visible, whereas chezmoi currently requires you to run chezmoi apply or chezmoi edit --apply. chezmoi will likely get an alternative solution to this too, see #752.\nYou can configure chezmoi to work like GNU Stow and have it create a set of symlinks back to a central directory, but this currently requires a bit of manual work (as described in #167). chezmoi might get some automation to help (see #886 for example) but it does need some convincing use cases that demonstrate that a symlink from a dotfile\u0026rsquo;s location to its contents in a central directory is better than just having the correct dotfile contents.\nDo I have to use chezmoi edit to edit my dotfiles? #  No. chezmoi edit is a convenience command that has a couple of useful features, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to use it. You can also run chezmoi cd and then just edit the files in the source state directly. After saving an edited file you can run chezmoi diff to check what effect the changes would have, and run chezmoi apply if you\u0026rsquo;re happy with them.\nchezmoi edit provides the following useful features:\n It opens the correct file in the source state for you, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to know anything about source state attributes. If the dotfile is encrypted in the source state, then chezmoi edit will decrypt it to a private directory, open that file in your $EDITOR, and then re-encrypt the file when you quit your editor. That makes encryption more transparent to the user. With the --diff and --apply options you can see what would change and apply those changes without having to run chezmoi diff or chezmoi apply. Note also that the arguments to chezmoi edit are the files in their target location.  Can I change how chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s source state is represented on disk? #  There are a number of criticisms of how chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s source state is represented on disk:\n The source file naming system cannot handle all possible filenames. Not all possible file permissions can be represented. The long source file names are weird and verbose. Everything is in a single directory, which can end up containing many entries.  chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s source state representation is a deliberate, practical compromise.\nCertain target filenames, for example ~/dot_example, are incompatible with chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s attributes used in the source state. In practice, dotfile filenames are unlikely to conflict with chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s attributes. If this does cause a genuine problem for you, please open an issue on GitHub.\nThe dot_ attribute makes it transparent which dotfiles are managed by chezmoi and which files are ignored by chezmoi. chezmoi ignores all files and directories that start with . so no special whitelists are needed for version control systems and their control files (e.g. .git and .gitignore).\nchezmoi needs per-file metadata to know how to interpret the source file\u0026rsquo;s contents, for example to know when the source file is a template or if the file\u0026rsquo;s contents are encrypted. By storing this metadata in the filename, the metadata is unambiguously associated with a single file and adding, updating, or removing a single file touches only a single file in the source state. Changes to the metadata (e.g. chezmoi chattr +template *target*) are simple file renames and isolated to the affected file.\nIf chezmoi were to, say, use a common configuration file listing which files were templates and/or encrypted, then changes to any file would require updates to the common configuration file. Automating updates to configuration files requires a round trip (read config file, update config, write config) and it is not always possible preserve comments and formatting.\nchezmoi\u0026rsquo;s attributes of executable_ and private_ only allow a the file permissions 0o644, 0o755, 0o600, and 0o700 to be represented. Directories can only have permissions 0o755 or 0o700. In practice, these cover all permissions typically used for dotfiles. If this does cause a genuine problem for you, please open an issue on GitHub.\nFile permissions and modes like executable_, private_, and symlink_ could also be stored in the filesystem, rather than in the filename. However, this requires the permissions to be preserved and handled by the underlying version control system and filesystem. chezmoi provides first-class support for Windows, where the executable_ and private_ attributes have no direct equivalents and symbolic links are not always permitted. By using regular files and directories, chezmoi avoids variations in the operating system, version control system, and filesystem making it both more robust and more portable.\nchezmoi uses a 1:1 mapping between entries in the source state and entries in the target state. This mapping is bi-directional and unambiguous.\nHowever, this also means that dotfiles that in the same directory in the target state must be in the same directory in the source state. In particular, every entry managed by chezmoi in the root of your home directory has a corresponding entry in the root of your source directory, which can mean that you end up with a lot of entries in the root of your source directory.\nIf chezmoi were to permit, say, multiple separate source directories (so you could, say, put dot_bashrc in a bash/ subdirectory, and dot_vimrc in a vim/ subdirectory, but have chezmoi apply map these to ~/.bashrc and ~/.vimrc in the root of your home directory) then the mapping between source and target states is no longer bidirectional nor unambiguous, which significantly increases complexity and requires more user interaction. For example, if both bash/dot_bashrc and vim/dot_bashrc exist, what should be the contents of ~/.bashrc? If you run chezmoi add ~/.zshrc, should dot_zshrc be stored in the source bash/ directory, the source vim/ directory, or somewhere else? How does the user communicate their preferences?\nchezmoi has many users and any changes to the source state representation must be backwards-compatible.\nIn summary, chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s source state representation is a compromise with both advantages and disadvantages. Changes to the representation will be considered, but must meet the following criteria, in order of importance:\n Be fully backwards-compatible for existing users. Fix a genuine problem encountered in practice. Be independent of the underlying operating system, version control system, and filesystem. Not add significant extra complexity to the user interface or underlying implementation.  gpg encryption fails. What could be wrong? #  The gpg.recipient key should be ultimately trusted, otherwise encryption will fail because gpg will prompt for input, which chezmoi does not handle. You can check the trust level by running:\ngpg --export-ownertrust  The trust level for the recipient\u0026rsquo;s key should be 6. If it is not, you can change the trust level by running:\ngpg --edit-key $recipient  Enter trust at the prompt and chose 5 = I trust ultimately.\nchezmoi reports \u0026ldquo;user: lookup userid NNNNN: input/output error\u0026rdquo; #  This is likely because the chezmoi binary you are using was statically compiled with musl and the machine you are running on uses LDAP or NIS.\nThe immediate fix is to use a package built for your distribution (e.g a .deb or .rpm) which is linked against glibc and includes LDAP/NIS support instead of the statically-compiled binary.\nIf the problem still persists, then please open an issue on GitHub.\nI\u0026rsquo;m getting errors trying to build chezmoi from source #  chezmoi requires Go version 1.16 or later. You can check the version of Go with:\ngo version  For more details on building chezmoi, see the Contributing Guide.\nWhat inspired chezmoi? #  chezmoi was inspired by Puppet, but was created because Puppet is an overkill for managing your personal configuration files. The focus of chezmoi will always be personal home directory management. If your needs grow beyond that, switch to a whole system configuration management tool.\nWhy not use Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Salt, or similar to manage my dotfiles instead? #  Whole system management tools are more than capable of managing your dotfiles, but are large systems that entail several disadvantages. Compared to whole system management tools, chezmoi offers:\n Small, focused feature set designed for dotfiles. There\u0026rsquo;s simply less to learn with chezmoi compared to whole system management tools. Easy installation and execution on every platform, without root access. Installing chezmoi requires only copying a single binary file with no external dependencies. Executing chezmoi just involves running the binary. In contrast, installing and running a whole system management tools typically requires installing a scripting language runtime, several packages, and running a system service, all typically requiring root access.  chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s focus and simple installation means that it runs almost everywhere: from tiny ARM-based Linux systems to Windows desktops, from inside lightweight containers to FreeBSD-based virtual machines in the cloud.\nCan I use chezmoi to manage files outside my home directory? #  In practice, yes, you can, but this is strongly discouraged beyond using your system\u0026rsquo;s package manager to install the packages you need.\nchezmoi is designed to operate on your home directory, and is explicitly not a full system configuration management tool. That said, there are some ways to have chezmoi manage a few files outside your home directory.\nchezmoi\u0026rsquo;s scripts can execute arbitrary commands, so you can use a run_ script that is run every time you run chezmoi apply, to, for example:\n Make the target file outside your home directory a symlink to a file managed by chezmoi in your home directory. Copy a file managed by chezmoi inside your home directory to the target file. Execute a template with chezmoi execute-template --output=filename template where filename is outside the target directory.  chezmoi executes all scripts as the user executing chezmoi, so you may need to add extra privilege elevation commands like sudo or PowerShell start -verb runas -wait to your script.\nchezmoi, by default, operates on your home directory but this can be overridden with the --destination command line flag or by specifying destDir in your config file, and could even be the root directory (/ or C:\\). This allows you, in theory, to use chezmoi to manage any file in your filesystem, but this usage is extremely strongly discouraged.\nIf your needs extend beyond modifying a handful of files outside your target system, then existing configuration management tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Salt are much better suited - and of course can be called from a chezmoi run_ script. Put your Puppet Manifests, Chef Recipes, Ansible Modules, and Salt Modules in a directory ignored by .chezmoiignore so they do not pollute your home directory.\nWhere does the name \u0026ldquo;chezmoi\u0026rdquo; come from? #  \u0026ldquo;chezmoi\u0026rdquo; splits to \u0026ldquo;chez moi\u0026rdquo; and pronounced /ʃeɪ mwa/ (shay-moi) meaning \u0026ldquo;at my house\u0026rdquo; in French. It\u0026rsquo;s seven letters long, which is an appropriate length for a command that is only run occasionally.\nWhat other questions have been asked about chezmoi? #  See the issues on GitHub.\nWhere do I ask a question that isn\u0026rsquo;t answered here? #  Please open an issue on GitHub.\nI like chezmoi. How do I say thanks? #  Thank you! chezmoi was written to scratch a personal itch, and I\u0026rsquo;m very happy that it\u0026rsquo;s useful to you. Please give chezmoi a star on GitHub, and if you\u0026rsquo;re happy to share your public dotfile repo then tag it with chezmoi.\nIf you write an article or give a talk on chezmoi please inform the author (e.g. by opening an issue) so it can be added to chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s media page.\nContributions are very welcome and every bug report, support request, and feature request helps make chezmoi better. Thank you :)\n"}),a.add({id:4,href:'/docs/how-to/',title:"How-To",section:"Docs",content:"How-To Guide #  Daily operations #  Use a hosted repo to manage your dotfiles across multiple machines #  chezmoi relies on your version control system and hosted repo to share changes across multiple machines. You should create a repo on the source code repository of your choice (e.g. Bitbucket, GitHub, or GitLab, many people call their repo dotfiles) and push the repo in the source directory here. For example:\nchezmoi cd git remote add origin https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git git push -u origin main exit  On another machine you can checkout this repo:\nchezmoi init https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git  You can then see what would be changed:\nchezmoi diff  If you\u0026rsquo;re happy with the changes then apply them:\nchezmoi apply  The above commands can be combined into a single init, checkout, and apply:\nchezmoi init --apply --verbose https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git  Pull the latest changes from your repo and apply them #  You can pull the changes from your repo and apply them in a single command:\nchezmoi update  This runs git pull --rebase in your source directory and then chezmoi apply.\nPull the latest changes from your repo and see what would change, without actually applying the changes #  Run:\nchezmoi git pull -- --rebase \u0026amp;\u0026amp; chezmoi diff  This runs git pull --rebase in your source directory and chezmoi diff then shows the difference between the target state computed from your source directory and the actual state.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re happy with the changes, then you can run\nchezmoi apply  to apply them.\nAutomatically commit and push changes to your repo #  chezmoi can automatically commit and push changes to your source directory to your repo. This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, add the following to your config file:\n[git] autoCommit = true autoPush = true  Whenever a change is made to your source directory, chezmoi will commit the changes with an automatically-generated commit message (if autoCommit is true) and push them to your repo (if autoPush is true). autoPush implies autoCommit, i.e. if autoPush is true then chezmoi will auto-commit your changes. If you only set autoCommit to true then changes will be committed but not pushed.\nBe careful when using autoPush. If your dotfiles repo is public and you accidentally add a secret in plain text, that secret will be pushed to your public repo.\nInstall chezmoi and your dotfiles on a new machine with a single command #  chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s install script can run chezmoi init for you by passing extra arguments to the newly installed chezmoi binary. If your dotfiles repo is github.com/\u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;/dotfiles then installing chezmoi, running chezmoi init, and running chezmoi apply can be done in a single line of shell:\nsh -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi)\u0026quot; -- init --apply \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;  If your dotfiles repo has a different name to dotfiles, or if you host your dotfiles on a different service, then see the reference manual for chezmoi init.\nFor setting up transitory environments (e.g. short-lived Linux containers) you can install chezmoi, install your dotfiles, and then remove all traces of chezmoi, including the source directory and chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s configuration directory, with a single command:\nsh -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi)\u0026quot; -- init --one-shot \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;  Manage different types of file #  Have chezmoi create a directory, but ignore its contents #  If you want chezmoi to create a directory, but ignore its contents, say ~/src, first run:\nmkdir -p $(chezmoi source-path)/src  This creates the directory in the source state, which means that chezmoi will create it (if it does not already exist) when you run chezmoi apply.\nHowever, as this is an empty directory it will be ignored by git. So, create a file in the directory in the source state that will be seen by git (so git does not ignore the directory) but ignored by chezmoi (so chezmoi does not include it in the target state):\ntouch $(chezmoi source-path)/src/.keep  chezmoi automatically creates .keep files when you add an empty directory with chezmoi add.\nEnsure that a target is removed #  Create a file called .chezmoiremove in the source directory containing a list of patterns of files to remove. When you run\nchezmoi apply --remove  chezmoi will remove anything in the target directory that matches the pattern. As this command is potentially dangerous, you should run chezmoi in verbose, dry-run mode beforehand to see what would be removed:\nchezmoi apply --remove --dry-run --verbose  .chezmoiremove is interpreted as a template, so you can remove different files on different machines. Negative matches (patterns prefixed with a !) or targets listed in .chezmoiignore will never be removed.\nPopulate ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with your public SSH keys from GitHub #  chezmoi can retrieve your public SSH keys from GitHub, which can be useful for populating your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. Put the following in your ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_ssh/authorized_keys.tmpl, where username is your GitHub username:\n{{ range (gitHubKeys \u0026quot;username\u0026quot;) -}} {{ .Key }} {{ end -}}  Include dotfiles from elsewhere #  Include a subdirectory from another repository, like Oh My Zsh #  To include a subdirectory from another repository, e.g. Oh My Zsh, you cannot use git submodules because chezmoi uses its own format for the source state and Oh My Zsh is not distributed in this format. Instead, you can use the import command to import a snapshot from a tarball:\ncurl -s -L -o oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/archive/master.tar.gz chezmoi import --strip-components 1 --destination ${HOME}/.oh-my-zsh oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz  Add oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz to .chezmoiignore if you run these commands in your source directory so that chezmoi doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to copy the tarball anywhere.\nDisable Oh My Zsh auto-updates by setting DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; in ~/.zshrc. Auto updates will cause the ~/.oh-my-zsh directory to drift out of sync with chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s source state. To update Oh My Zsh, re-run the curl and chezmoi import commands above.\nHandle configuration files which are externally modified #  Some programs modify their configuration files. When you next run chezmoi apply, any modifications made by the program will be lost.\nYou can track changes to these files by replacing with a symlink back to a file in your source directory, which is under version control. Here is a worked example for VSCode\u0026rsquo;s settings.json on Linux:\nCopy the configuration file to your source directory:\ncp ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json $(chezmoi source-path)  Tell chezmoi to ignore this file:\necho settings.json \u0026gt;\u0026gt; $(chezmoi source-path)/.chezmoiignore  Tell chezmoi that ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json should be a symlink to the file in your source directory:\nmkdir -p $(chezmoi source-path)/private_dot_config/private_Code/User echo -n \u0026quot;{{ .chezmoi.sourceDir }}/settings.json\u0026quot; \u0026gt; $(chezmoi source-path)/private_dot_config/private_Code/User/symlink_settings.json.tmpl  The prefix private_ is used because the ~/.config and ~/.config/Code directories are private by default.\nApply the changes:\nchezmoi apply -v  Now, when the program modifies its configuration file it will modify the file in the source state instead.\nImport archives #  It is occasionally useful to import entire archives of configuration into your source state. The import command does this. For example, to import the latest version github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh to ~/.oh-my-zsh run:\ncurl -s -L -o oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/archive/master.tar.gz chezmoi import --strip-components 1 --destination ~/.oh-my-zsh oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz  Note that this only updates the source state. You will need to run\nchezmoi apply  to update your destination directory.\nManage machine-to-machine differences #  Use templates #  The primary goal of chezmoi is to manage configuration files across multiple machines, for example your personal macOS laptop, your work Ubuntu desktop, and your work Linux laptop. You will want to keep much configuration the same across these, but also need machine-specific configurations for email addresses, credentials, etc. chezmoi achieves this functionality by using text/template for the source state where needed.\nFor example, your home ~/.gitconfig on your personal machine might look like:\n[user] email = \u0026quot;john@home.org\u0026quot;  Whereas at work it might be:\n[user] email = \u0026quot;john.smith@company.com\u0026quot;  To handle this, on each machine create a configuration file called ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml defining variables that might vary from machine to machine. For example, for your home machine:\n[data] email = \u0026quot;john@home.org\u0026quot;  Note that all variable names will be converted to lowercase. This is due to a feature of a library used by chezmoi.\nIf you intend to store private data (e.g. access tokens) in ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml, make sure it has permissions 0600.\nIf you prefer, you can use any format supported by Viper for your configuration file. This includes JSON, YAML, and TOML. Variable names must start with a letter and be followed by zero or more letters or digits.\nThen, add ~/.gitconfig to chezmoi using the --autotemplate flag to turn it into a template and automatically detect variables from the data section of your ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml file:\nchezmoi add --autotemplate ~/.gitconfig  You can then open the template (which will be saved in the file ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_gitconfig.tmpl):\nchezmoi edit ~/.gitconfig  The file should look something like:\n[user] email = \u0026quot;{{ .email }}\u0026quot;  To disable automatic variable detection, use the --template or -T option to chezmoi add instead of --autotemplate.\nTemplates are often used to capture machine-specific differences. For example, in your ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc.tmpl you might have:\n# common config export EDITOR=vi # machine-specific configuration {{- if eq .chezmoi.hostname \u0026quot;work-laptop\u0026quot; }} # this will only be included in ~/.bashrc on work-laptop {{- end }}  For a full list of variables, run:\nchezmoi data  For more advanced usage, you can use the full power of the text/template language. chezmoi includes all of the text functions from sprig and its own functions for interacting with password managers.\nTemplates can be executed directly from the command line, without the need to create a file on disk, with the execute-template command, for example:\nchezmoi execute-template '{{ .chezmoi.os }}/{{ .chezmoi.arch }}'  This is useful when developing or debugging templates.\nSome password managers allow you to store complete files. The files can be retrieved with chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s template functions. For example, if you have a file stored in 1Password with the UUID uuid then you can retrieve it with the template:\n{{- onepasswordDocument \u0026quot;uuid\u0026quot; -}}  The -s inside the brackets remove any whitespace before or after the template expression, which is useful if your editor has added any newlines.\nIf, after executing the template, the file contents are empty, the target file will be removed. This can be used to ensure that files are only present on certain machines. If you want an empty file to be created anyway, you will need to give it an empty_ prefix.\nFor coarser-grained control of files and entire directories managed on different machines, or to exclude certain files completely, you can create .chezmoiignore files in the source directory. These specify a list of patterns that chezmoi should ignore, and are interpreted as templates. An example .chezmoiignore file might look like:\nREADME.md {{- if ne .chezmoi.hostname \u0026quot;work-laptop\u0026quot; }} .work # only manage .work on work-laptop {{- end }}  The use of ne (not equal) is deliberate. What we want to achieve is \u0026ldquo;only install .work if hostname is work-laptop\u0026rdquo; but chezmoi installs everything by default, so we have to turn the logic around and instead write \u0026ldquo;ignore .work unless the hostname is work-laptop\u0026rdquo;.\nPatterns can be excluded by prefixing them with a !, for example:\nf* !foo  will ignore all files beginning with an f except foo.\nUse completely different dotfiles on different machines #  chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s template functionality allows you to change a file\u0026rsquo;s contents based on any variable. For example, if you want ~/.bashrc to be different on Linux and macOS you would create a file in the source state called dot_bashrc.tmpl containing:\n{{ if eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;darwin\u0026quot; -}} # macOS .bashrc contents {{ else if eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot; -}} # Linux .bashrc contents {{ end -}} However, if the differences between the two versions are so large that you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to use completely separate files in the source state, you can achieve this using a symbolic link template. Create the following files:\nsymlink_dot_bashrc.tmpl:\n.bashrc_{{ .chezmoi.os }} dot_bashrc_darwin:\n# macOS .bashrc contents dot_bashrc_linux:\n# Linux .bashrc contents .chezmoiignore\n{{ if ne .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;darwin\u0026quot; }} .bashrc_darwin {{ end }} {{ if ne .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot; }} .bashrc_linux {{ end }} This will make ~/.bashrc a symlink to .bashrc_darwin on darwin and to .bashrc_linux on linux. The .chezmoiignore configuration ensures that only the OS-specific .bashrc_os file will be installed on each OS.\nWithout using symlinks #  The same thing can be achieved using the include function.\ndot_bashrc.tmpl\n{{ if eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;darwin\u0026quot; }} {{ include \u0026quot;.bashrc_darwin\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} {{ if eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot; }} {{ include \u0026quot;.bashrc_linux\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Create a config file on a new machine automatically #  chezmoi init can also create a config file automatically, if one does not already exist. If your repo contains a file called .chezmoi.\u0026lt;format\u0026gt;.tmpl where format is one of the supported config file formats (e.g. json, toml, or yaml) then chezmoi init will execute that template to generate your initial config file.\nSpecifically, if you have .chezmoi.toml.tmpl that looks like this:\n{{- $email := promptString \u0026quot;email\u0026quot; -}} [data] email = {{ $email | quote }}  Then chezmoi init will create an initial chezmoi.toml using this template. promptString is a special function that prompts the user (you) for a value.\nTo test this template, use chezmoi execute-template with the --init and --promptString flags, for example:\nchezmoi execute-template --init --promptString email=john@home.org \u0026lt; ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoi.toml.tmpl  Re-create your config file #  If you change your config file template, chezmoi will warn you if your current config file was not generated from that template. You can re-generate your config file by running:\nchezmoi init  If you are using any prompt* template functions in your config file template you will be prompted again. However, you can avoid this with the following example template logic:\n{{- $email := get . \u0026quot;email\u0026quot; -}} {{- if not $email -}} {{- $email = promptString \u0026quot;email\u0026quot; -}} {{- end -}} [data] email = {{ $email | quote }}  This will cause chezmoi to first try to re-use the existing $email variable and fallback to promptString only if it is not set.\nFor boolean variables you can use:\n{{- $var := false -}} {{- if (hasKey . \u0026quot;var\u0026quot;) -}} {{- $var = get . \u0026quot;var\u0026quot; -}} {{- end -}} [data] var = $var  Handle different file locations on different systems with the same contents #  If you want to have the same file contents in different locations on different systems, but maintain only a single file in your source state, you can use a shared template.\nCreate the common file in the .chezmoitemplates directory in the source state. For example, create .chezmoitemplates/file.conf. The contents of this file are available in templates with the template *name* function where name is the name of the file.\nThen create files for each system, for example Library/Application Support/App/file.conf.tmpl for macOS and dot_config/app/file.conf.tmpl for Linux. Both template files should contain {{- template \u0026quot;file.conf\u0026quot; -}}.\nFinally, tell chezmoi to ignore files where they are not needed by adding lines to your .chezmoiignore file, for example:\n{{ if ne .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;darwin\u0026quot; }} Library/Application Support/App/file.conf {{ end }} {{ if ne .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot; }} .config/app/file.conf {{ end }} Export archives #  chezmoi can create an archive containing the target state. This can be useful for generating target state for a different machine. Note also that you can specify a different configuration file (including template variables) with the --config option.\nKeep data private #  chezmoi automatically detects when files and directories are private when adding them by inspecting their permissions. Private files and directories are stored in ~/.local/share/chezmoi as regular, public files with permissions 0644 and the name prefix private_. For example:\nchezmoi add ~/.netrc  will create ~/.local/share/chezmoi/private_dot_netrc (assuming ~/.netrc is not world- or group- readable, as it should be). This file is still private because ~/.local/share/chezmoi is not group- or world- readable or executable. chezmoi checks that the permissions of ~/.local/share/chezmoi are 0700 on every run and will print a warning if they are not.\nIt is common that you need to store access tokens in config files, e.g. a GitHub access token. There are several ways to keep these tokens secure, and to prevent them leaving your machine.\nUse a password manager #  Bitwarden #  chezmoi includes support for Bitwarden using the Bitwarden CLI to expose data as a template function.\nLog in to Bitwarden using:\nbw login \u0026lt;bitwarden-email\u0026gt;  Unlock your Bitwarden vault:\nbw unlock  Set the BW_SESSION environment variable, as instructed.\nThe structured data from bw get is available as the bitwarden template function in your config files, for example:\nusername = {{ (bitwarden \u0026quot;item\u0026quot; \u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot;).login.username }} password = {{ (bitwarden \u0026quot;item\u0026quot; \u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot;).login.password }}  Custom fields can be accessed with the bitwardenFields template function. For example, if you have a custom field named token you can retrieve its value with:\n{{ (bitwardenFields \u0026quot;item\u0026quot; \u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot;).token.value }}  gopass #  chezmoi includes support for gopass using the gopass CLI.\nThe first line of the output of gopass show \u0026lt;pass-name\u0026gt; is available as the gopass template function, for example:\n{{ gopass \u0026quot;\u0026lt;pass-name\u0026gt;\u0026quot; }}  KeePassXC #  chezmoi includes support for KeePassXC using the KeePassXC CLI (keepassxc-cli) to expose data as a template function.\nProvide the path to your KeePassXC database in your configuration file:\n[keepassxc] database = \u0026quot;/home/user/Passwords.kdbx\u0026quot;  The structured data from keepassxc-cli show $database is available as the keepassxc template function in your config files, for example:\nusername = {{ (keepassxc \u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot;).UserName }} password = {{ (keepassxc \u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot;).Password }}  Additional attributes are available through the keepassxcAttribute function. For example, if you have an entry called SSH Key with an additional attribute called private-key, its value is available as:\n{{ keepassxcAttribute \u0026quot;SSH Key\u0026quot; \u0026quot;private-key\u0026quot; }}  Keychain and Windows Credentials Manager #  chezmoi includes support for Keychain (on macOS), GNOME Keyring (on Linux), and Windows Credentials Manager (on Windows) via the zalando/go-keyring library.\nSet values with:\n$ chezmoi secret keyring set --service=\u0026lt;service\u0026gt; --user=\u0026lt;user\u0026gt; Value: xxxxxxxx  The value can then be used in templates using the keyring function which takes the service and user as arguments.\nFor example, save a GitHub access token in keyring with:\n$ chezmoi secret keyring set --service=github --user=\u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Value: xxxxxxxx  and then include it in your ~/.gitconfig file with:\n[github] user = \u0026quot;{{ .github.user }}\u0026quot; token = \u0026quot;{{ keyring \u0026quot;github\u0026quot; .github.user }}\u0026quot;  You can query the keyring from the command line:\nchezmoi secret keyring get --service=github --user=\u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;  LastPass #  chezmoi includes support for LastPass using the LastPass CLI to expose data as a template function.\nLog in to LastPass using:\nlpass login \u0026lt;lastpass-username\u0026gt;  Check that lpass is working correctly by showing password data:\nlpass show --json \u0026lt;lastpass-entry-id\u0026gt;  where \u0026lt;lastpass-entry-id\u0026gt; is a LastPass Entry Specification.\nThe structured data from lpass show --json id is available as the lastpass template function. The value will be an array of objects. You can use the index function and .Field syntax of the text/template language to extract the field you want. For example, to extract the password field from first the \u0026ldquo;GitHub\u0026rdquo; entry, use:\ngithubPassword = \u0026quot;{{ (index (lastpass \u0026quot;GitHub\u0026quot;) 0).password }}\u0026quot;  chezmoi automatically parses the note value of the Lastpass entry as colon-separated key-value pairs, so, for example, you can extract a private SSH key like this:\n{{ (index (lastpass \u0026quot;SSH\u0026quot;) 0).note.privateKey }}  Keys in the note section written as CamelCase Words are converted to camelCaseWords.\nIf the note value does not contain colon-separated key-value pairs, then you can use lastpassRaw to get its raw value, for example:\n{{ (index (lastpassRaw \u0026quot;SSH Private Key\u0026quot;) 0).note }}  1Password #  chezmoi includes support for 1Password using the 1Password CLI to expose data as a template function.\nLog in and get a session using:\neval $(op signin \u0026lt;subdomain\u0026gt;.1password.com \u0026lt;email\u0026gt;)  The output of op get item \u0026lt;uuid\u0026gt; is available as the onepassword template function. chezmoi parses the JSON output and returns it as structured data. For example, if the output of op get item \u0026quot;\u0026lt;uuid\u0026gt;\u0026quot; is:\n{ \u0026quot;uuid\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;uuid\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;details\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;password\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;xxx\u0026quot; } }  Then you can access details.password with the syntax:\n{{ (onepassword \u0026quot;\u0026lt;uuid\u0026gt;\u0026quot;).details.password }}  Login details fields can be retrieved with the onepasswordDetailsFields function, for example:\n{{- (onepasswordDetailsFields \u0026quot;uuid\u0026quot;).password.value }}  Documents can be retrieved with:\n{{- onepasswordDocument \u0026quot;uuid\u0026quot; -}}  Note the extra - after the opening {{ and before the closing }}. This instructs the template language to remove and whitespace before and after the substitution. This removes any trailing newline added by your editor when saving the template.\npass #  chezmoi includes support for pass using the pass CLI.\nThe first line of the output of pass show \u0026lt;pass-name\u0026gt; is available as the pass template function, for example:\n{{ pass \u0026quot;\u0026lt;pass-name\u0026gt;\u0026quot; }}  Vault #  chezmoi includes support for Vault using the Vault CLI to expose data as a template function.\nThe vault CLI needs to be correctly configured on your machine, e.g. the VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN environment variables must be set correctly. Verify that this is the case by running:\nvault kv get -format=json \u0026lt;key\u0026gt;  The structured data from vault kv get -format=json is available as the vault template function. You can use the .Field syntax of the text/template language to extract the data you want. For example:\n{{ (vault \u0026quot;\u0026lt;key\u0026gt;\u0026quot;).data.data.password }}  A custom password manager #  You can use any command line tool that outputs secrets either as a string or in JSON format. Choose the binary by setting secret.command in your configuration file. You can then invoke this command with the secret and secretJSON template functions which return the raw output and JSON-decoded output respectively. All of the above secret managers can be supported in this way:\n   Secret Manager secret.command Template skeleton     1Password op {{ secretJSON \u0026quot;get\u0026quot; \u0026quot;item\u0026quot; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; }}   Bitwarden bw {{ secretJSON \u0026quot;get\u0026quot; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; }}   Hashicorp Vault vault {{ secretJSON \u0026quot;kv\u0026quot; \u0026quot;get\u0026quot; \u0026quot;-format=json\u0026quot; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; }}   LastPass lpass {{ secretJSON \u0026quot;show\u0026quot; \u0026quot;--json\u0026quot; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; }}   KeePassXC keepassxc-cli Not possible (interactive command only)   pass pass {{ secret \u0026quot;show\u0026quot; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; }}    Encrypt whole files #  gpg #  chezmoi supports encrypting files with gpg. Encrypted files are stored in the source state and automatically be decrypted when generating the target state or printing a file\u0026rsquo;s contents with chezmoi cat. chezmoi edit will transparently decrypt the file before editing and re-encrypt it afterwards.\nAsymmetric (private/public-key) encryption #  Specify the encryption key to use in your configuration file (chezmoi.toml) with the gpg.recipient key:\nencryption = \u0026quot;gpg\u0026quot; [gpg] recipient = \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;  Add files to be encrypted with the --encrypt flag, for example:\nchezmoi add --encrypt ~/.ssh/id_rsa  chezmoi will encrypt the file with:\ngpg --armor --recipient ${gpg.recipient} --encrypt  and store the encrypted file in the source state. The file will automatically be decrypted when generating the target state.\nSymmetric encryption #  Specify symmetric encryption in your configuration file:\nencryption = \u0026quot;gpg\u0026quot; [gpg] symmetric = true  Add files to be encrypted with the --encrypt flag, for example:\nchezmoi add --encrypt ~/.ssh/id_rsa  chezmoi will encrypt the file with:\ngpg --armor --symmetric  Use a private configuration file and template variables #  Typically, ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml is not checked in to version control and has permissions 0600. You can store tokens as template values in the data section. For example, if your ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml contains:\n[data] [data.github] user = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;\u0026quot; token = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;github-token\u0026gt;\u0026quot;  Your ~/.local/share/chezmoi/private_dot_gitconfig.tmpl can then contain:\n{{- if (index . \u0026quot;github\u0026quot;) }} [github] user = \u0026quot;{{ .github.user }}\u0026quot; token = \u0026quot;{{ .github.token }}\u0026quot; {{- end }}  Any config files containing tokens in plain text should be private (permissions 0600).\nUse scripts to perform actions #  Understand how scripts work #  chezmoi supports scripts, which are executed when you run chezmoi apply. The scripts can either run every time you run chezmoi apply, or only when their contents have changed.\nIn verbose mode, the script\u0026rsquo;s contents will be printed before executing it. In dry-run mode, the script is not executed.\nScripts are any file in the source directory with the prefix run_, and are executed in alphabetical order. Scripts that should only be run when their contents change have the prefix run_once_.\nScripts break chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s declarative approach, and as such should be used sparingly. Any script should be idempotent, even run_once_ scripts.\nScripts must be created manually in the source directory, typically by running chezmoi cd and then creating a file with a run_ prefix. Scripts are executed directly using exec and must include a shebang line or be executable binaries. There is no need to set the executable bit on the script.\nScripts with the suffix .tmpl are treated as templates, with the usual template variables available. If, after executing the template, the result is only whitespace or an empty string, then the script is not executed. This is useful for disabling scripts.\nInstall packages with scripts #  Change to the source directory and create a file called run_once_install-packages.sh:\nchezmoi cd $EDITOR run_once_install-packages.sh  In this file create your package installation script, e.g.\n#!/bin/sh sudo apt install ripgrep  The next time you run chezmoi apply or chezmoi update this script will be run. As it has the run_once_ prefix, it will not be run again unless its contents change, for example if you add more packages to be installed.\nThis script can also be a template. For example, if you create run_once_install-packages.sh.tmpl with the contents:\n{{ if eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot; -}} #!/bin/sh sudo apt install ripgrep {{ else if eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;darwin\u0026quot; -}} #!/bin/sh brew install ripgrep {{ end -}}  This will install ripgrep on both Debian/Ubuntu Linux systems and macOS.\nUse chezmoi with GitHub Codespaces, Visual Studio Codespaces, Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers #  The following assumes you are using chezmoi 1.8.4 or later. It does not work with earlier versions of chezmoi.\nYou can use chezmoi to manage your dotfiles in GitHub Codespaces, Visual Studio Codespaces, and Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers.\nFor a quick start, you can clone the chezmoi/dotfiles repository which supports Codespaces out of the box.\nThe workflow is different to using chezmoi on a new machine, notably:\n These systems will automatically clone your dotfiles repo to ~/dotfiles, so there is no need to clone your repo yourself. The installation script must be non-interactive. When running in a Codespace, the environment variable CODESPACES will be set to true. You can read its value with the env template function.  First, if you are using a chezmoi configuration file template, ensure that it is non-interactive when running in Codespaces, for example, .chezmoi.toml.tmpl might contain:\n{{- $codespaces:= env \u0026quot;CODESPACES\u0026quot; | not | not -}} sourceDir = \u0026quot;{{ .chezmoi.sourceDir }}\u0026quot; [data] name = \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; codespaces = {{ $codespaces }} {{- if $codespaces }}{{/* Codespaces dotfiles setup is non-interactive, so set an email address */}} email = \u0026quot;your@email.com\u0026quot; {{- else }}{{/* Interactive setup, so prompt for an email address */}} email = \u0026quot;{{ promptString \u0026quot;email\u0026quot; }}\u0026quot; {{- end }} This sets the codespaces template variable, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to repeat (env \u0026quot;CODESPACES\u0026quot;) in your templates. It also sets the sourceDir configuration to the --source argument passed in chezmoi init.\nSecond, create an install.sh script that installs chezmoi and your dotfiles:\n#!/bin/sh  set -e # -e: exit on error if [ ! \u0026#34;$(command -v chezmoi)\u0026#34; ]; then bin_dir=\u0026#34;$HOME/.local/bin\u0026#34; chezmoi=\u0026#34;$bin_dir/chezmoi\u0026#34; if [ \u0026#34;$(command -v curl)\u0026#34; ]; then sh -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsLS https://git.io/chezmoi)\u0026#34; -- -b \u0026#34;$bin_dir\u0026#34; elif [ \u0026#34;$(command -v wget)\u0026#34; ]; then sh -c \u0026#34;$(wget -qO- https://git.io/chezmoi)\u0026#34; -- -b \u0026#34;$bin_dir\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;To install chezmoi, you must have curl or wget installed.\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit 1 fi else chezmoi=chezmoi fi # POSIX way to get script\u0026#39;s dir: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29834779/12156188 script_dir=\u0026#34;$(cd -P -- \u0026#34;$(dirname -- \u0026#34;$(command -v -- \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34;)\u0026#34;)\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pwd -P)\u0026#34; # exec: replace current process with chezmoi init exec \u0026#34;$chezmoi\u0026#34; init --apply \u0026#34;--source=$script_dir\u0026#34; Ensure that this file is executable (chmod a+x install.sh), and add install.sh to your .chezmoiignore file.\nIt installs the latest version of chezmoi in ~/.local/bin if needed, and then chezmoi init ... invokes chezmoi to create its configuration file and initialize your dotfiles. --apply tells chezmoi to apply the changes immediately, and --source=... tells chezmoi where to find the cloned dotfiles repo, which in this case is the same folder in which the script is running from.\nIf you do not use a chezmoi configuration file template you can use chezmoi apply --source=$HOME/dotfiles instead of chezmoi init ... in install.sh.\nFinally, modify any of your templates to use the codespaces variable if needed. For example, to install vim-gtk on Linux but not in Codespaces, your run_once_install-packages.sh.tmpl might contain:\n{{- if (and (eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot;)) (not .codespaces))) -}} #!/bin/sh sudo apt install -y vim-gtk {{- end -}} Use chezmoi on Windows #  Detect Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) #  WSL can be detected by looking for the string Microsoft in /proc/kernel/osrelease, which is available in the template variable .chezmoi.kernel.osrelease, for example:\nWSL 1:\n{{ if (eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot;) }} {{ if (contains \u0026quot;Microsoft\u0026quot; .chezmoi.kernel.osrelease) }} # WSL-specific code {{ end }} {{ end }} WSL 2:\n{{ if (eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot;) }} {{ if (contains \u0026quot;microsoft\u0026quot; .chezmoi.kernel.osrelease) }} # WSL-specific code {{ end }} {{ end }} WSL 2 since version 4.19.112:\n{{ if (eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot;) }} {{ if (contains \u0026quot;microsoft-WSL2\u0026quot; .chezmoi.kernel.osrelease) }} # WSL-specific code {{ end }} {{ end }} Run a PowerShell script as admin on Windows #  Put the following at the top of your script:\n# Self-elevate the script if required if (-Not ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] \u0026#39;Administrator\u0026#39;)) { if ([int](Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object -ExpandProperty BuildNumber) -ge 6000) { $CommandLine = \u0026#34;-NoExit -File `\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path + \u0026#34;`\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + $MyInvocation.UnboundArguments Start-Process -FilePath PowerShell.exe -Verb Runas -ArgumentList $CommandLine Exit } } Using custom tools #  Customize the diff command #  By default, chezmoi uses a built-in diff. You can change the format, and/or pipe the output into a pager of your choice. For example, to use diff-so-fancy specify:\n[diff] format = \u0026quot;git\u0026quot; pager = \u0026quot;diff-so-fancy\u0026quot;  The format can also be set with the --format option to the diff command, and the pager can be disabled using --no-pager.\nUse a merge tool other than vimdiff #  By default, chezmoi uses vimdiff, but you can use any merge tool of your choice. In your config file, specify the command and args to use. For example, to use neovim\u0026rsquo;s diff mode specify:\n[merge] command = \u0026quot;nvim\u0026quot; args = \u0026quot;-d\u0026quot;  Migrating to chezmoi from another dotfile manager #  Migrate from a dotfile manager that uses symlinks #  Many dotfile managers replace dotfiles with symbolic links to files in a common directory. If you chezmoi add such a symlink, chezmoi will add the symlink, not the file. To assist with migrating from symlink-based systems, use the --follow option to chezmoi add, for example:\nchezmoi add --follow ~/.bashrc  This will tell chezmoi add that the target state of ~/.bashrc is the target of the ~/.bashrc symlink, rather than the symlink itself. When you run chezmoi apply, chezmoi will replace the ~/.bashrc symlink with the file contents.\nMigrate away from chezmoi #  chezmoi creates regular files and directories - your home directory managed by chezmoi is exactly the same as if you were using no dotfile manager at all. Use your new dotfile manager\u0026rsquo;s functionality for importing your existing dotfiles.\n"}),a.add({id:5,href:'/docs/install/',title:"Install",section:"Docs",content:"Install Guide #  One-line binary install #  Install the correct binary for your operating system and architecture in ./bin with a single command:\nsh -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi)\u0026quot;

Some state is encoded in the source names.\nThe following prefixes and suffixes are special, and are collectively referred to as \u0026ldquo;attributes\u0026rdquo;:\n   Prefix Effect     after_ Run script after updating the destination.   before_ Run script before updating the destination.   create_ Ensure that the file exists, and create it with contents if it does not.   dot_ Rename to use a leading dot, e.g. dot_foo becomes .foo.   empty_ Ensure the file exists, even if is empty. By default, empty files are removed.   encrypted_ Encrypt the file in the source state.   exact_ Remove anything not managed by chezmoi.   executable_ Add executable permissions to the target file.   modify_ Treat the contents as a script that modifies an existing file.   once_ Run script once.   private_ Remove all group and world permissions from the target file or directory.   run_ Treat the contents as a script to run.   symlink_ Create a symlink instead of a regular file.       Suffix Effect     .tmpl Treat the contents of the source file as a template.    Different target types allow different prefixes and suffixes. The order of prefixes is important.\n   Target type Source type Allowed prefixes in order Allowed suffixes     Directory Directory exact_, private_, dot_ none   Regular file File encrypted_, private_, executable_, dot_ .tmpl   Create file File create_, encrypted_, private_, executable_, dot_ .tmpl   Modify file File modify_, encrypted_, private_, executable_, dot_ .tmpl   Script File run_, once_, before_ or after_ .tmpl   Symbolic link File symlink_, dot_, .tmpl    In addition, if the source file is encrypted, the suffix .age (when age encryption is used) or .asc (when gpg encryption is used) is stripped. These suffixes can be overridden with the age.suffix and gpg.suffix configuration variables.\nchezmoi ignores all files and directories in the source directory that begin with a . with the exception of files and directories that begin with .chezmoi.\nTarget types #  chezmoi will create, update, and delete files, directories, and symbolic links in the destination directory, and run scripts. chezmoi deterministically performs actions in ASCII order of their target name. For example, given a file dot_a, a script run_z, and a directory exact_dot_c, chezmoi will first create .a, create .c, and then execute run_z.\nFiles #  Files are represented by regular files in the source state. The encrypted_ attribute determines whether the file in the source state is encrypted. The executable_ attribute will set the executable bits when the file is written to the target state, and the private_ attribute will clear all group and world permissions. Files with the .tmpl suffix will be interpreted as templates. If the target contents are empty then the file will be removed, unless it has an empty_ prefix.\nCreate file #  Files with the create_ prefix will be created in the target state with the contents of the file in the source state if they do not already exist. If the file in the destination state already exists then its contents will be left unchanged.\nModify file #  Files with the modify_ prefix are treated as scripts that modify an existing file. The contents of the existing file (which maybe empty if the existing file does not exist or is empty) are passed to the script\u0026rsquo;s standard input, and the new contents are read from the scripts standard output.\nDirectories #  Directories are represented by regular directories in the source state. The exact_ attribute causes chezmoi to remove any entries in the target state that are not explicitly specified in the source state, and the private_ attribute causes chezmoi to clear all group and world permssions.\nSymbolic links #  Symbolic links are represented by regular files in the source state with the prefix symlink_. The contents of the file will have a trailing newline stripped, and the result be interpreted as the target of the symbolic link. Symbolic links with the .tmpl suffix in the source state are interpreted as templates. If the target of the symbolic link is empty or consists only of whitespace, then the target is removed.\nScripts #  Scripts are represented as regular files in the source state with prefix run_. The file\u0026rsquo;s contents (after being interpreted as a template if it has a .tmpl suffix) are executed. Scripts are executed on every chezmoi apply, unless they have the once_ attribute, in which case they are only executed when they are first found or when their contents have changed.\nScripts with the before_ attribute are executed before any files, directories, or symlinks are updated. Scripts with the after_ attribute are executed after all files, directories, and symlinks have been updated. Scripts without an before_ or after_ attribute are executed in ASCII order of their target names with respect to files, directories, and symlinks.\nScripts will normally run with their working directory set to their equivalent location in the destination directory. For example, a script in ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dir/run_script will be run with a working directory of ~/dir. If the equivalent location in the destination directory either does not exist or is not a directory, then chezmoi will walk up the script\u0026rsquo;s directory hierarchy and run the script in the first directory that exists and is a directory.\nSpecial files and directories #  All files and directories in the source state whose name begins with . are ignored by default, unless they are one of the special files listed here.\n.chezmoi.\u0026lt;format\u0026gt;.tmpl #  If a file called .chezmoi.\u0026lt;format\u0026gt;.tmpl exists then chezmoi init will use it to create an initial config file. format must be one of the the supported config file formats.\n.chezmoi.\u0026lt;format\u0026gt;.tmpl examples #  {{ $email := promptString \u0026quot;email\u0026quot; -}} data: email: \u0026quot;{{ $email }}\u0026quot;  .chezmoiignore #  If a file called .chezmoiignore exists in the source state then it is interpreted as a set of patterns to ignore. Patterns are matched using doublestar.PathMatch and match against the target path, not the source path.\nPatterns can be excluded by prefixing them with a ! character. All excludes take priority over all includes.\nComments are introduced with the # character and run until the end of the line.\n.chezmoiignore is interpreted as a template. This allows different files to be ignored on different machines.\n.chezmoiignore files in subdirectories apply only to that subdirectory.\n.chezmoiignore examples #  README.md *.txt # ignore *.txt in the target directory */*.txt # ignore *.txt in subdirectories of the target directory backups/** # ignore backups folder in chezmoi directory and all its contents # but not in subdirectories of subdirectories; # so a/b/c.txt would *not* be ignored backups/** # ignore all contents of backups folder in chezmoi directory # but not backups folder itself {{- if ne .email \u0026quot;john.smith@company.com\u0026quot; }} # Ignore .company-directory unless configured with a company email .company-directory # note that the pattern is not dot_company-directory {{- end }} {{- if ne .email \u0026quot;john@home.org }} .personal-file {{- end }}  .chezmoiremove #  If a file called .chezmoiremove exists in the source state then it is interpreted as a list of targets to remove. .chezmoiremove is interpreted as a template.\n.chezmoitemplates #  If a directory called .chezmoitemplates exists, then all files in this directory are parsed as templates are available as templates with a name equal to the relative path of the file.\n.chezmoitemplates examples #  Given:\n.chezmoitemplates/foo {{ if true }}bar{{ end }} dot_config.tmpl {{ template \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; }}  The target state of .config will be bar.\n.chezmoiversion #  If a file called .chezmoiversion exists, then its contents are interpreted as a semantic version defining the minimum version of chezmoi required to interpret the source state correctly. chezmoi will refuse to interpret the source state if the current version is too old.\n.chezmoiversion examples #  1.5.0  Commands #  add targets #  Add targets to the source state. If any target is already in the source state, then its source state is replaced with its current state in the destination directory. The add command accepts additional flags:\n--autotemplate #  Automatically generate a template by replacing strings with variable names from the data section of the config file. Longer substitutions occur before shorter ones. This implies the --template option.\n-e, --empty #  Set the empty attribute on added files.\n-f, --force #  Add targets, even if doing so would cause a source template to be overwritten.\n--follow #  If the last part of a target is a symlink, add the target of the symlink instead of the symlink itself.\n--exact #  Set the exact attribute on added directories.\n-i, --include types #  Only add entries of type types.\n-p, --prompt #  Interactively prompt before adding each file.\n-r, --recursive #  Recursively add all files, directories, and symlinks.\n-T, --template #  Set the template attribute on added files and symlinks.\n--template-symlinks #  When adding symlink to an absolute path in the source directory or destination directory, create a symlink template with .chezmoi.sourceDir or .chezmoi.homeDir.

This defaults to true. Set this to false to simulate creating the config file with no existing template data.\n--depth depth #  Clone the repo with depth depth.\n--one-shot #  --one-shot is the equivalent of --apply, --depth=1, --force, --purge, and --purge-binary. It attempts to install your dotfiles with chezmoi and then remove all traces of chezmoi from the system. This is useful for setting up temporary environments (e.g. Docker containers).\n--purge #  Remove the source and config directories after applying.\n--purge-binary #  Attempt to remove the chezmoi binary after applying.\ninit examples #  chezmoi init user chezmoi init user --apply chezmoi init user --apply --purge chezmoi init user/dots chezmoi init gitlab.com/user  import filename #  Import the source state from an archive file in to a directory in the source state.

This is primarily for verifying chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s integration with your secret manager. Normally you would use template functions to retrieve secrets. Note that if you want to pass flags to the secret manager\u0026rsquo;s CLI you will need to separate them with -- to prevent chezmoi from interpreting them.\nTo get a full list of available commands run:\nchezmoi secret help  secret examples #  chezmoi secret keyring set --service=service --user=user --value=password chezmoi secret keyring get --service=service --user=user  source-path [targets] #  Print the path to each target\u0026rsquo;s source state.

This will call the GitHub API to determine if there is a new version of chezmoi available, and if so, download and attempt to install it in the same way as chezmoi was previously installed.\nIf the any of the CHEZMOI_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN, GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN, or GITHUB_TOKEN environment variables are set, then the first value found will be used to authenticate requests to the GitHub API, otherwise unauthenticated requests are used which are subject to stricter rate limiting. Unauthenticated requests should be sufficient for most cases.\nverify [targets] #  Verify that all targets match their target state. chezmoi exits with code 0 (success) if all targets match their target state, or 1 (failure) otherwise. If no targets are specified then all targets are checked.\n-i, --include types #  Only include entries of type types.\nverify examples #  chezmoi verify chezmoi verify ~/.bashrc  Editor configuration #  The edit and edit-config commands use the editor specified by the VISUAL environment variable, the EDITOR environment variable, or vi, whichever is specified first.\nUmask configuration #  By default, chezmoi uses your current umask as set by your operating system and shell. chezmoi only stores crude permissions in its source state, namely in the executable and private attributes, corresponding to the umasks of 0o111 and 0o077 respectively.\nFor machine-specific control of umask, set the umask configuration variable in chezmoi\u0026rsquo;s configuration file, for example:\numask = 0o22  Template execution #  chezmoi executes templates using text/template. The result is treated differently depending on whether the target is a file or a symlink.\nIf target is a file, then:\n If the result is an empty string, then the file is removed. Otherwise, the target file contents are result.  If the target is a symlink, then:\n Leading and trailing whitespace are stripped from the result. If the result is an empty string, then the symlink is removed. Otherwise, the target symlink target is the result.  chezmoi executes templates using text/template\u0026rsquo;s missingkey=error option, which means that misspelled or missing keys will raise an error. This can be overridden by setting a list of options in the configuration file, for example:\n[template] options = [\u0026quot;missingkey=zero\u0026quot;]  For a full list of options, see Template.Option.\nTemplate variables #  chezmoi provides the following automatically-populated variables:\n   Variable Value     .chezmoi.arch Architecture, e.g. amd64, arm, etc. as returned by runtime.GOARCH.   .chezmoi.fqdnHostname The fully-qualified domain name hostname of the machine chezmoi is running on.   .chezmoi.group The group of the user running chezmoi.   .chezmoi.homeDir The home directory of the user running chezmoi.   .chezmoi.hostname The hostname of the machine chezmoi is running on, up to the first ..   .chezmoi.kernel Contains information from /proc/sys/kernel.

For example, you can use the hostname of the machine to create different configurations on different machines.\nchezmoi uses the text/template syntax from Go extended with text template functions from sprig.\nWhen reading files from the source state, chezmoi interprets them as a template if either of the following is true:\n The file name has a .tmpl suffix. The file is in the .chezmoitemplates directory, or a subdirectory of .chezmoitemplates.  Template data #  chezmoi provides a variety of template variables. For a full list, run\nchezmoi data  These come from a variety of sources:\n Variables populated by chezmoi are in .chezmoi, for example .chezmoi.os. Variables created by you in the data section of the configuration file.  Furthermore, chezmoi provides a variety of functions to retrieve data at runtime from password managers, environment variables, and the filesystem.\nCreating a template file #  There are several ways to create a template:\n  When adding a file for the first time, pass the --template argument, for example:\nchezmoi add --template ~/.zshrc    When adding a file for the first time, you can pass the --autotemplate argument, which tells chezmoi to make the file as a template and automatically replace variables that chezmoi knows about, for example:\nchezmoi add --autotemplate ~/.zshrc    If a file is already managed by chezmoi, but is not a template, you can make it a template by running, for example:\nchezmoi chattr +template ~/.zshrc    You can create a template manually in the source directory by giving it a .tmpl extension, for example:\nchezmoi cd $EDITOR dot_zshrc.tmpl    Templates in .chezmoitemplates must be created manually, for example:\nchezmoi cd mkdir -p .chezmoitemplates cd .chezmoitemplates $EDITOR mytemplate    Editing a template file #  The easiest way to edit a template is to use chezmoi edit, for example:\nchezmoi edit ~/.zshrc  This will open the source file for ~/.zshrc in $EDITOR. When you quit the editor, chezmoi will check the template syntax.\nIf you want the changes you make to be immediately applied after you quit the editor, use the --apply option, for example:\nchezmoi edit --apply ~/.zshrc  Testing templates #  Templates can be tested with the chezmoi execute-template command which treats each of its arguments as a template and executes it. This can be useful for testing small fragments of templates, for example:\nchezmoi execute-template '{{ .chezmoi.hostname }}'  If there are no arguments, chezmoi execute-template will read the template from the standard input. This can be useful for testing whole files, for example:\nchezmoi cd chezmoi execute-template \u0026lt; dot_zshrc.tmpl  Template syntax #  Template actions are written inside double curly brackets, {{ and }}. Actions can be variables, pipelines, or control statements. Text outside actions is copied literally.\nVariables are written literally, for example:\n{{ .chezmoi.hostname }}  Conditional expressions can be written using if, else if, else, and end, for example:\n{{ if (eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;darwin\u0026quot;) }} # darwin {{ else if (eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot; ) }} # linux {{ else }} # other operating system {{ end }}  For a full description of the template syntax, see the text/template documentation.\nRemoving whitespace #  For formatting reasons you might want to leave some whitespace after or before the template code. This whitespace will remain in the final file, which you might not want.\nA solution for this is to place a minus sign and a space next to the brackets. So {{-  for the left brackets and  -}} for the right brackets. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nHOSTNAME= {{- .chezmoi.hostname }}  This will result in\nHOSTNAME=myhostname  Notice that this will remove any number of tabs, spaces and even newlines and carriage returns.\nDebugging templates #  If there is a mistake in one of your templates and you want to debug it, chezmoi can help you. You can use this subcommand to test and play with the examples in these docs as well.\nThere is a very handy subcommand called execute-template. chezmoi will interpret any data coming from stdin or at the end of the command. It will then interpret all templates and output the result to stdout. For example with the command:\nchezmoi execute-template '{{ .chezmoi.os }}/{{ .chezmoi.arch }}'  chezmoi will output the current OS and architecture to stdout.\nYou can also feed the contents of a file to this command by typing:\ncat foo.txt | chezmoi execute-template  Simple logic #  A very useful feature of chezmoi templates is the ability to perform logical operations.\n# common config export EDITOR=vi # machine-specific configuration {{- if eq .chezmoi.hostname \u0026quot;work-laptop\u0026quot; }} # this will only be included in ~/.bashrc on work-laptop {{- end }}  In this example chezmoi will look at the hostname of the machine and if that is equal to \u0026ldquo;work-laptop\u0026rdquo;, the text between the if and the end will be included in the result.\nBoolean functions #     Function Return value     eq Returns true if the first argument is equal to any of the other arguments.   not Returns the boolean negation of its single argument.   and Returns the boolean AND of its arguments by returning the first empty argument or the last argument, that is, and x y behaves as if x then y else x. All the arguments are evaluated.   or Returns the boolean OR of its arguments by returning the first non-empty argument or the last argument, that is, or x y behaves as if x then x else y All the arguments are evaluated.    Integer functions #     Function Return value     len Returns the integer length of its argument.   eq Returns the boolean truth of arg1 == arg2.   ne Returns the boolean truth of arg1 != arg2.   lt Returns the boolean truth of arg1 \u0026lt; arg2.   le Returns the boolean truth of arg1 \u0026lt;= arg2.   gt Returns the boolean truth of arg1 \u0026gt; arg2.   ge Returns the boolean truth of arg1 \u0026gt;= arg2.    More complicated logic #  Up until now, we have only seen if statements that can handle at most two variables. In this part we will see how to create more complicated expressions.\nYou can also create more complicated expressions. The eq command can accept multiple arguments. It will check if the first argument is equal to any of the other arguments.\n{{ if eq \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; }}one{{end}} {{ if eq \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; }}hello{{end}} {{ if eq \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; }}hello{{end}}  The first two examples will output hello and the last example will output nothing.\nThe operators or and and can also accept multiple arguments.\nChaining operators #  You can perform multiple checks in one if statement.\n{{ if (and (eq .chezmoi.os \u0026quot;linux\u0026quot;) (ne .email \u0026quot;john@home.org\u0026quot;)) }} ... {{ end }}  This will check if the operating system is Linux and the configured email is not the home email. The brackets are needed here, because otherwise all the arguments will be give to the and command.\nThis way you can chain as many operators together as you like.\nHelper functions #  chezmoi has added multiple helper functions to the text/template syntax.\nchezmoi includes sprig, an extension to the text/template format that contains many helper functions. Take a look at their documentation for a list.\nchezmoi adds a few functions of its own as well. Take a look at the reference for complete list.\nTemplate variables #  chezmoi defines a few useful templates variables that depend on the system you are currently on. A list of the variables defined by chezmoi can be found here.\nThere are, however more variables than that. To view the variables available on your system, execute:\nchezmoi data  This outputs the variables in JSON format by default. To access the variable chezmoi.kernel.osrelease in a template, use\n{{ .chezmoi.kernel.osrelease }}  This way you can also access the variables you defined yourself.\nUsing .chezmoitemplates for creating similar files #  When you have multiple similar files, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t quite the same, you can create a template file in the directory .chezmoitemplates. This template can be inserted in other template files, for example:\nCreate .local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoitemplates/alacritty:\nsome: config fontsize: {{ . }} more: config  Notice the file name doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to end in .tmpl, as all files in the directory .chezmoitemplates are interpreted as templates.\nCreate other files using the template .local/share/chezmoi/small-font.yml.tmpl\n{{- template \u0026quot;alacritty\u0026quot; 12 -}}  .local/share/chezmoi/big-font.yml.tmpl\n{{- template \u0026quot;alacritty\u0026quot; 18 -}}  Here we\u0026rsquo;re calling the shared alacritty template with the font size as the . value passed in. You can test this with chezmoi cat:\n$ chezmoi cat ~/small-font.yml some: config fontsize: 12 more: config $ chezmoi cat ~/big-font.yml some: config fontsize: 18 more: config  Passing multiple arguments #  In the example above only one arguments is passed to the template. To pass more arguments to the template, you can do it in two ways.\nVia the config file #  This method is useful if you want to use the same template arguments multiple times, because you don\u0026rsquo;t specify the arguments every time. Instead you specify them in the file .config/chezmoi/.chezmoi.toml:\n[data.alacritty.big] fontsize = 18 font = \u0026#34;DejaVu Serif\u0026#34; [data.alacritty.small] fontsize = 12 font = \u0026#34;DejaVu Sans Mono\u0026#34; Use the variables in .local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoitemplates/alacritty:\nsome: config fontsize: {{ .fontsize }} font: {{ .font }} more: config  And connect them with .local/share/chezmoi/small-font.yml.tmpl:\n{{- template \u0026quot;alacritty\u0026quot; .alacritty.small -}}  At the moment, this means that you\u0026rsquo;ll have to duplicate the alacritty data in the config file on every machine, but a feature will be added to avoid this.\nBy passing a dictionary #  Using the same alacritty configuration as above, you can pass the arguments to it with a dictionary, for example .local/share/chezmoi/small-font.yml.tmpl:\n{{- template \u0026quot;alacritty\u0026quot; dict \u0026quot;fontsize\u0026quot; 12 \u0026quot;font\u0026quot; \u0026quot;DejaVu Sans Mono\u0026quot; -}}  "})})()
