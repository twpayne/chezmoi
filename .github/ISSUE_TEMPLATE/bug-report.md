#### Troubleshooting

- [ ] I ran `chezmoi doctor`, fixed as many issues as possible, and retried my command.
- [ ] I have double-checked the instructions for [Installation](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) and the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/QUICKSTART.md).
- [ ] I have searched for previous issues that have been reported/opened, and none of them relate to my problem.
