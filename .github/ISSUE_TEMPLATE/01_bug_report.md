#### Troubleshooting
- [ ] I ran `chezmoi doctor` and fixed as many issues as possible and retried my command.
- [ ] I have double checked the instructions for [Installation](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) and the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/docs/QUICKSTART.md).
- [ ] I have search for previous issues that have been reported/opened, and none of them relate to my problem.

Failure to follow the troubleshooting steps (and to report information requested below), may make it difficult to provide the proper support required. Furthermore, your issue may be closed without reply, if the instructions were not properly followed.
