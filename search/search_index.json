Why should I use a dotfile manager? Dotfile managers give you the combined benefit of a consistent environment everywhere with an undo command and a restore from backup. As the core of our development environments become increasingly standardized (e.g. using git at both home and work), and we further customize them, at the same time we increasingly work in ephemeral environments like Docker containers, virtual machines, and GitHub Codespaces. In the same way that nobody would use an editor without an undo command, or develop software without a version control system, chezmoi brings the investment that you have made in mastering your tools to every environment that you work in. I already have a system to manage my dotfiles, why should I use chezmoi? Quote I\u2019ve been using Chezmoi for more than a year now, across at least 3 computers simultaneously, and I really love it. Most of all, I love how fast I can configure a new machine when I use it. In just a couple minutes of work, I can kick off a process on a brand-new computer that will set up my dotfiles and install all my usual software so it feels like a computer I\u2019ve been using for years. I also appreciate features like secrets management, which allow me to share my dotfiles while keeping my secrets safe. Overall, I love the way Chezmoi fits so perfectly into the niche of managing dotfiles. \u2014 @mike_kasberg Quote I had initially been turned off when I first encountered [chezmoi], because [chezmoi] seemed overkill for (what appeared to me) a simple task. But the problem of managing a relatively small number of dotfiles across a relatively small number of machines with small differences between them and keeping them up to date proved to be MUCH more complex than I imagined. Copy things around by hand, and then later distributing them via source control got hairy very quickly. I finally realized all those features were absolutely necessary to manage things sanely, and once I took some time to learn how to do things with chezmoi, I have never looked back. \u2014 njt Quote Regular reminder that chezmoi is the best dotfile manager utility I've used and you can too \u2014 @mbbroberg If you're using any of the following methods: A custom shell script. An existing dotfile manager like dotbot , rcm , homesick , vcsh , yadm , or GNU Stow . A bare git repo . Then you've probably run into at least one of the following problems. ...if coping with differences between machines requires extra effort If you want to synchronize your dotfiles across multiple operating systems or distributions, then you may need to manually perform extra steps to cope with differences from machine to machine. You might need to run different commands on different machines, maintain separate per-machine files or branches (with the associated hassle of merging, rebasing, or copying each change), or hope that your custom logic handles the differences correctly. chezmoi uses a single source of truth (a single branch) and a single command that works on every machine. Individual files can be templates to handle machine to machine differences, if needed. ...if you have to keep your dotfiles repo private Quote And regarding dotfiles, I saw that. It's only public dotfiles repos so I have to evaluate my dotfiles history to be sure. I have secrets scanning and more, but it was easier to keep it private for security, I'm ok mostly though. I'm using chezmoi and it's easier now \u2014 @sheldon_hull If your system stores secrets in plain text, then you must be very careful about where you clone your dotfiles. If you clone them on your work machine then anyone with access to your work machine (e.g. your IT department) will have access to your home secrets. If you clone it on your home machine then you risk leaking work secrets. With chezmoi you can store secrets in your password manager or encrypt them, and even store passwords in different ways on different machines. You can clone your dotfiles repository anywhere, and even make your dotfiles repo public, without leaving personal secrets on your work machine or work secrets on your personal machine. ...if you have to maintain your own tool Quote I've offloaded my dotfiles deployment from a homespun shell script to chezmoi. I'm quite happy with this decision. \u2014 @gotgenes Quote I discovered chezmoi and it's pretty cool, just migrated my old custom multi-machine sync dotfile setup and it's so much simpler now in case you're wondering I have written 0 code \u2014 @buritica Quote Chezmoi is like what you might get if you re-wrote my bash script in Go, came up with better solutions than diff for managing config on multiple machines, added in secrets management and other useful dotfile tools, and tweaked and perfected it over years. @mike_kasberg If your system was written by you for your personal use, then it probably has the functionality that you needed when you wrote it.

As the core of our development environments become increasingly standardized (e.g. using git at both home and work), and we further customize them, at the same time we increasingly work in ephemeral environments like Docker containers, virtual machines, and GitHub Codespaces.

Most of all, I love how fast I can configure a new machine when I use it. In just a couple minutes of work, I can kick off a process on a brand-new computer that will set up my dotfiles and install all my usual software so it feels like a computer I\u2019ve been using for years. I also appreciate features like secrets management, which allow me to share my dotfiles while keeping my secrets safe. Overall, I love the way Chezmoi fits so perfectly into the niche of managing dotfiles. \u2014 @mike_kasberg Quote I had initially been turned off when I first encountered [chezmoi], because [chezmoi] seemed overkill for (what appeared to me) a simple task. But the problem of managing a relatively small number of dotfiles across a relatively small number of machines with small differences between them and keeping them up to date proved to be MUCH more complex than I imagined. Copy things around by hand, and then later distributing them via source control got hairy very quickly. I finally realized all those features were absolutely necessary to manage things sanely, and once I took some time to learn how to do things with chezmoi, I have never looked back. \u2014 njt Quote Regular reminder that chezmoi is the best dotfile manager utility I've used and you can too \u2014 @mbbroberg If you're using any of the following methods: A custom shell script. An existing dotfile manager like dotbot , rcm , homesick , vcsh , yadm , or GNU Stow . A bare git repo .

You might need to run different commands on different machines, maintain separate per-machine files or branches (with the associated hassle of merging, rebasing, or copying each change), or hope that your custom logic handles the differences correctly. chezmoi uses a single source of truth (a single branch) and a single command that works on every machine.

You can generate Go documentation for chezmoi's source code with go doc , for example: $ go doc -all -u github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/v2/pkg/chezmoi You can also browse chezmoi's generated documentation online . Directory structure The important directories in chezmoi are: Directory Contents assets/chezmoi.io/docs/ The documentation single source of truth. Help text, examples, and the chezmoi.io website are generated from the files in this directory pkg/chezmoi/ chezmoi's core functionality pkg/cmd/ Code for the chezmoi command pkg/cmd/testdata/scripts/ High-level tests of chezmoi's commands using testscript Key concepts As described in the reference manual , chezmoi evaluates the source state to compute a target state for the destination directory (typically your home directory). It then compares the target state to the actual state of the destination directory and performs any changes necessary to update the destination directory to match the target state. These concepts are represented directly in chezmoi's code. chezmoi uses the generic term entry to describe something that it manages. Entries can be files, directories, symlinks, scripts, amongst other things. pkg/chezmoi/ directory All of chezmoi's interaction with the operating system is abstracted through the System interface. A System includes functionality to read and write files and directories and execute commands. chezmoi makes a distinction between idempotent commands that can be run multiple times without modifying the underlying system and arbitrary commands that may modify the underlying system. The real underlying system is implemented via a RealSystem struct. Other System s are composed on top of this to provide further functionality. For example, the --debug flag is implemented by wrapping the RealSystem with a DebugSystem that logs all calls to the underlying RealSystem . --dry-run is implemented by wrapping the RealSystem with a DryRunSystem that allows reads to pass through but silently discards all writes. The SourceState struct represents a source state, including reading a source state from the source directory, executing templates, applying the source state (i.e. updating a System to match the desired source state), and adding more entries to the source state. Entries in the source state are abstracted by the SourceStateEntry interface implemented by the SourceStateFile and SourceStateDir structs, as the source state only consists of regular files and directories. A SourceStateFile includes a FileAttr struct describing the attributes parsed from its file name. Similarly, a SourceStateDir includes a DirAttr struct describing the directory attributes parsed from a directory name. SourceStateEntry s can compute their target state entries, i.e. what the equivalent entry should be in the target state, abstracted by the TargetStateEntry interface. Actual target state entries include TargetStateFile structs, representing a file with contents and permissions, TargetStateDir structs, representing a directory, TargetStateSymlink for symlinks, TargetStateRemove for entries that should be removed, and TargetStateScript for scripts that should be run. The actual state of an entry in the target state is abstracted via the ActualStateEntry interface, with ActualStateAbsent , ActualStateDir , ActualStateFile , ActualStateSymlink structs implementing this interface. Finally, an EntryState struct represents a serialization of an ActualEntryState for storage in and retrieval from chezmoi's persistent state. It stores a SHA256 of the entry's contents, rather than the full contents, to avoid storing secrets in the persistent state. With these concepts, chezmoi's apply command is effectively: Read the source state from the source directory. For each entry in the source state ( SourceStateEntry ), compute its TargetStateEntry and read its actual state in the destination state ( ActualStateEntry ). If the ActualStateEntry is not equivalent to the TargetStateEntry then apply the minimal set of changes to the ActualStateEntry so that they are equivalent. Furthermore, chezmoi stores the EntryState of each entry that it writes in its persistent state. chezmoi can then detect if a third party has updated a target since chezmoi last wrote it by comparing the actual state entry in the target state with the entry state in the persistent state. pkg/cmd/ directory pkg/cmd/*cmd.go contains the code for each individual command and pkg/cmd/*templatefuncs.go contain the template functions. Commands are defined as methods on the Config struct. The Config struct is large, containing all configuration values read from the config file, command line arguments, and computed and cached values. The Config.persistentPreRunRootE and Config.persistentPostRunRootE methods set up and tear down state for individual commands based on the command's Annotations field. Path handling chezmoi uses separate types for absolute paths ( AbsPath ) and relative paths ( RelPath ) to avoid errors where paths are combined (e.g. joining two absolute paths). A further type SourceRelPath is a relative path within the source directory and handles file and directory attributes. Internally, chezmoi normalizes all paths to use forward slashes with an optional upper-cased Windows volume so they can be compared with string comparisons. Paths read from the user may include tilde ( ~ ) to represent the user's home directory, use forward or backward slashes, and are treated as external paths ( ExtPath ). These are normalized to absolute paths. chezmoi is case-sensitive internally and makes no attempt to handle case-insensitive or case-preserving filesystems. Persistent state Persistent state is treated as a two-level key-value store with the pseudo-structure map[Bucket]map[Key]Value , where Bucket , Key , and Value are all []byte s. The PersistentState interface defines interaction with them. Sometimes temporary persistent states are used. For example, in dry run mode ( --dry-run ) the actual persistent state is copied into a temporary persistent state in memory which remembers writes but does not persist them to disk. Encryption Encryption tools are abstracted by the Encryption interface that contains methods of encrypting and decrypting files and []byte s. Implementations are the AGEEncryption and GPGEncryption structs. A DebugEncryption struct wraps an Encryption interface and logs the methods called. run_once_ and run_onchange_ scripts The execution of a run_once_ script is recorded by storing the SHA256 of its contents in the scriptState bucket in the persistent state. On future invocations the script is only run if no matching contents SHA256 is found in the persistent state. The execution of a run_onchange_ script is recorded by storing its target name in the entryState bucket along with its contents SHA256 sum. On future invocations the script is only run if its contents SHA256 sum has changed, and its contents SHA256 sum is then updated in the persistent state. Testing chezmoi has a mix of, unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Unit and integration tests use the github.com/stretchr/testify framework. End-to-end tests use github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript with the test scripts themselves in pkg/cmd/testdata/scripts/$TEST_NAME.txt . You can run individual end-to-end tests with $ go test ./pkg/cmd -run = TestScript/ $TEST_NAME Tests should, if at all possible, run unmodified on all operating systems tested in CI (Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD).

The command date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ returns the current time in RFC3339 format, e.g. 2019-11-23T18:29:25Z . $BUILT_BY should be a string indicating what system was used to build the binary. Typically it should be the name of your packaging system, e.g. homebrew . Please enable cgo, if possible. chezmoi can be built and run without cgo, but the .chezmoi.username and .chezmoi.group template variables may not be set correctly on some systems. chezmoi includes an upgrade command which attempts to self-upgrade. You can remove this command completely by building chezmoi with the noupgrade build tag. chezmoi includes shell completions in the completions directory. Please include these in the package and install them in the shell-appropriate directory, if possible. If the instructions for installing chezmoi in chezmoi's install guide are absent or incorrect, please open an issue or submit a PR to correct them.","title":"Packaging"},{"location":"developer/releases/","text":"Releases Releases are managed with goreleaser .

Files Files are represented by regular files in the source state. The encrypted_ attribute determines whether the file in the source state is encrypted. The executable_ attribute will set the executable bits in the target state, and the private_ attribute will clear all group and world permissions. The readonly_ attribute will clear all write permission bits in the target state. Files with the .tmpl suffix will be interpreted as templates.

Create file Files with the create_ prefix will be created in the target state with the contents of the file in the source state if they do not already exist. If the file in the destination state already exists then its contents will be left unchanged. Modify file Files with the modify_ prefix are treated as scripts that modify an existing file. The contents of the existing file (which maybe empty if the existing file does not exist or is empty) are passed to the script's standard input, and the new contents are read from the script's standard output. Remove entry Files with the remove_ prefix will cause the corresponding entry (file, directory, or symlink) to be removed in the target state. Directories Directories are represented by regular directories in the source state. The exact_ attribute causes chezmoi to remove any entries in the target state that are not explicitly specified in the source state, and the private_ attribute causes chezmoi to clear all group and world permissions. The readonly_ attribute will clear all write permission bits. Symbolic links Symbolic links are represented by regular files in the source state with the prefix symlink_ . The contents of the file will have a trailing newline stripped, and the result be interpreted as the target of the symbolic link. Symbolic links with the .tmpl suffix in the source state are interpreted as templates. If the target of the symbolic link is empty or consists only of whitespace, then the target is removed. Scripts Scripts are represented as regular files in the source state with prefix run_ . The file's contents (after being interpreted as a template if it has a .tmpl suffix) are executed.

For more details, check the reference manual . Include a subdirectory from a URL To include a subdirectory from another repository, e.g. Oh My Zsh , you cannot use git submodules because chezmoi uses its own format for the source state and Oh My Zsh is not distributed in this format. Instead, you can use the .chezmoiexternal.$FORMAT to tell chezmoi to import dotfiles from an external source. For example, to import Oh My Zsh, the zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin , and powerlevel10k , put the following in ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml : ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml [\".oh-my-zsh\"] type = \"archive\" url = \"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/archive/master.tar.gz\" exact = true stripComponents = 1 refreshPeriod = \"168h\" [\".oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting\"] type = \"archive\" url = \"https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/archive/master.tar.gz\" exact = true stripComponents = 1 refreshPeriod = \"168h\" [\".oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k\"] type = \"archive\" url = \"https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/archive/v1.15.0.tar.gz\" exact = true stripComponents = 1 To apply the changes, run: $ chezmoi apply chezmoi will download the archives and unpack them as if they were part of the source state. chezmoi caches downloaded archives locally to avoid re-downloading them every time you run a chezmoi command, and will only re-download them at most every refreshPeriod (default never). In the above example refreshPeriod is set to 168h (one week) for .oh-my-zsh and .oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting because the URL point to tarballs of the master branch, which changes over time. No refresh period is set for .oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k because the URL points to the a tarball of a tagged version, which does not change over time. To bump the version of powerlevel10k, change the version in the URL. To force a refresh the downloaded archives, use the --refresh-externals flag to chezmoi apply : $ chezmoi --refresh-externals apply --refresh-externals can be shortened to -R : $ chezmoi -R apply When using Oh My Zsh, make sure you disable auto-updates by setting DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=\"true\" in ~/.zshrc . Auto updates will cause the ~/.oh-my-zsh directory to drift out of sync with chezmoi's source state. To update Oh My Zsh and its plugins, refresh the downloaded archives. Include a subdirectory with selected files from a URL Use include pattern filters to include only selected files from an archive URL. For example, to import just the required source files of the zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin in the example above, add in include filter to the zsh-syntax-highlighting section as shown below: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml [\".oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting\"] type = \"archive\" url = \"https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/archive/master.tar.gz\" exact = true stripComponents = 1 refreshPeriod = \"168h\" include = [ \"*/*.zsh\" , \"*/.version\" , \"*/.revision-hash\" , \"*/highlighters/**\" ] Include a single file from a URL Including single files uses the same mechanism as including a subdirectory above, except with the external type file instead of archive . For example, to include plug.vim from github.com/junegunn/vim-plug in ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim put the following in ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml : ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml [\".vim/autoload/plug.vim\"] type = \"file\" url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim\" refreshPeriod = \"168h\" Include a subdirectory from a git repository You can configure chezmoi to keep a git repository up to date in a subdirectory by using the external type git-repo , for example: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml [\".vim/pack/alker0/chezmoi.vim\"] type = \"git-repo\" url = \"https://github.com/alker0/chezmoi.vim.git\" refreshPeriod = \"168h\" If the directory does not exist then chezmoi will run git clone to clone it.

Extract a single file from an archive You can extract a single file from an archive using the $ENTRY.filter.command and $ENTRY.filter.args variables in .chezmoiexternal.$FORMAT , for example: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml {{ $ ageVersion : = \"1.0.0\" - }} [\".local/bin/age\"] type = \"file\" url = \"https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/releases/download/v{{ $ageVersion }}/age-v{{ $ageVersion }}-{{ .chezmoi.os }}-{{ .chezmoi.arch }}.tar.gz\" executable = true refreshPeriod = \"168h\" [\".local/bin/age\".filter] command = \"tar\" args = [ \"--extract\" , \"--file\" , \"/dev/stdin\" , \"--gzip\" , \"--to-stdout\" , \"age/age\" ] This will extract the single archive member age/age from the given URL (which is computed for the current OS and architecture) to the target ./local/bin/age and set its executable bit. Import archives It is occasionally useful to import entire archives of configuration into your source state. The import command does this. For example, to import the latest version github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh to ~/.oh-my-zsh run: $ curl -s -L -o ${ TMPDIR } /oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/archive/master.tar.gz $ mkdir -p $( chezmoi source-path ) /dot_oh-my-zsh $ chezmoi import --strip-components 1 --destination ~/.oh-my-zsh ${ TMPDIR } /oh-my-zsh-master.tar.gz Note This only updates the source state.

For example, to import Oh My Zsh, the zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin , and powerlevel10k , put the following in ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml : ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml [\".oh-my-zsh\"] type = \"archive\" url = \"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/archive/master.tar.gz\" exact = true stripComponents = 1 refreshPeriod = \"168h\" [\".oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting\"] type = \"archive\" url = \"https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/archive/master.tar.gz\" exact = true stripComponents = 1 refreshPeriod = \"168h\" [\".oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k\"] type = \"archive\" url = \"https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/archive/v1.15.0.tar.gz\" exact = true stripComponents = 1 To apply the changes, run: $ chezmoi apply chezmoi will download the archives and unpack them as if they were part of the source state. chezmoi caches downloaded archives locally to avoid re-downloading them every time you run a chezmoi command, and will only re-download them at most every refreshPeriod (default never).

Manage part, but not all, of a file chezmoi, by default, manages whole files, but there are two ways to manage just parts of a file. Firstly, a modify_ script receives the current contents of the file on the standard input and chezmoi reads the target contents of the file from the script's standard output. This can be used to change parts of a file, for example using sed . Hint If you need random access to the file to modify it, then you can write standard input to a temporary file, modify the temporary file, and then write the temporary file to the standard output, for example: #!/bin/sh tempfile = \" $( mktemp ) \" trap 'rm -rf \"${tempfile}\"' EXIT cat > \" ${ tempfile } \" # modify ${tempfile} cat \" ${ tempfile } \" Note If the file does not exist then the standard input to the modify_ script will be empty and it is the script's responsibility to write a complete file to the standard output. Secondly, if only a small part of the file changes then consider using a template to re-generate the full contents of the file from the current state.

See related software for more information. Manage a file's permissions, but not its contents chezmoi's create_ attributes allows you to tell chezmoi to create a file if it does not already exist. chezmoi, however, will apply any permission changes from the executable_ , private_ , and readonly_ attributes. This can be used to control a file's permissions without altering its contents. For example, if you want to ensure that ~/.kube/config always has permissions 600 then if you create an empty file called dot_kube/private_config in your source state, chezmoi will ensure ~/.kube/config 's permissions are 0600 when you run chezmoi apply without changing its contents. This approach does have the downside that chezmoi will create the file if it does not already exist. If you only want chezmoi apply to set a file's permissions if it already exists and not create the file otherwise, you can use a run_ script. For example, create a file in your source state called run_set_kube_config_permissions.sh containing: #!/bin/sh FILE = \" $HOME /.kube/config\" if [ -f \" $FILE \" ] ; then if [ \" $( stat -c %a \" $FILE \" ) \" ! = \"600\" ] ; then chmod 600 \" $FILE \" fi fi Handle configuration files which are externally modified Some programs modify their configuration files.

You will want to keep much configuration the same across these, but also need machine-specific configurations for email addresses, credentials, etc. chezmoi achieves this functionality by using text/template for the source state where needed. For example, your home ~/.gitconfig on your personal machine might look like: ~/.gitconfig [user] email = \"me@home.org\" Whereas at work it might be: ~/.gitconfig [user] email = \"firstname.lastname@company.com\" To handle this, on each machine create a configuration file called ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml defining variables that might vary from machine to machine. For example, for your home machine: ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml [data] email = \"me@home.org\" If you intend to store private data (e.g. access tokens) in ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml , make sure it has permissions 0600 . If you prefer, you can use JSON or YAML for your configuration file. Variable names must start with a letter and be followed by zero or more letters or digits. Then, add ~/.gitconfig to chezmoi using the --autotemplate flag to turn it into a template and automatically detect variables from the data section of your ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml file: $ chezmoi add --autotemplate ~/.gitconfig You can then open the template (which will be saved in the file ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_gitconfig.tmpl ): $ chezmoi edit ~/.gitconfig The file should look something like: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_gitconfig.tmpl [user] email = {{ . email | quote }} To disable automatic variable detection, use the --template or -T option to chezmoi add instead of --autotemplate . Templates are often used to capture machine-specific differences. For example, in your ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc.tmpl you might have: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc.tmpl # common config export EDITOR=vi # machine-specific configuration {{- if eq .chezmoi.hostname \"work-laptop\" }} # this will only be included in ~/.bashrc on work-laptop {{- end }} For a full list of variables, run: $ chezmoi data For more advanced usage, you can use the full power of the text/template language. chezmoi includes all of the text functions from sprig and its own functions for interacting with password managers . Templates can be executed directly from the command line, without the need to create a file on disk, with the execute-template command, for example: $ chezmoi execute-template \"{{ .chezmoi.os }}/{{ .chezmoi.arch }}\" This is useful when developing or debugging templates. Some password managers allow you to store complete files. The files can be retrieved with chezmoi's template functions. For example, if you have a file stored in 1Password with the UUID uuid then you can retrieve it with the template: {{- onepasswordDocument \"uuid\" -}} The - s inside the brackets remove any whitespace before or after the template expression, which is useful if your editor has added any newlines. If, after executing the template, the file contents are empty, the target file will be removed. This can be used to ensure that files are only present on certain machines. If you want an empty file to be created anyway, you will need to give it an empty_ prefix. Ignore files or a directory on different machines For coarser-grained control of files and entire directories managed on different machines, or to exclude certain files completely, you can create .chezmoiignore files in the source directory. These specify a list of patterns that chezmoi should ignore, and are interpreted as templates. An example .chezmoiignore file might look like: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiignore README.md {{- if ne .chezmoi.hostname \"work-laptop\" }} .work # only manage .work on work-laptop {{- end }} The use of ne (not equal) is deliberate. What we want to achieve is \"only install .work if hostname is work-laptop \" but chezmoi installs everything by default, so we have to turn the logic around and instead write \"ignore .work unless the hostname is work-laptop \". Patterns can be excluded by prefixing them with a ! , for example: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiignore f* !foo will ignore all files beginning with an f except foo . You can see what files chezmoi ignores with the command $ chezmoi ignored Handle different file locations on different systems with the same contents If you want to have the same file contents in different locations on different systems, but maintain only a single file in your source state, you can use a shared template. Create the common file in the .chezmoitemplates directory in the source state. For example, create .chezmoitemplates/file.conf . The contents of this file are available in templates with the template $NAME . function where $NAME is the name of the file ( . passes the current data to the template code in file.conf ; see https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Actions for details). Then create files for each system, for example Library/Application Support/App/file.conf.tmpl for macOS and dot_config/app/file.conf.tmpl for Linux. Both template files should contain {{- template \"file.conf\" . -}} . Finally, tell chezmoi to ignore files where they are not needed by adding lines to your .chezmoiignore file, for example: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiignore {{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" }} Library/Application Support/App/file.conf {{ end }} {{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"linux\" }} .config/app/file.conf {{ end }} Use completely different dotfiles on different machines chezmoi's template functionality allows you to change a file's contents based on any variable. For example, if you want ~/.bashrc to be different on Linux and macOS you would create a file in the source state called dot_bashrc.tmpl containing: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc.tmpl {{ if eq .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" -}} # macOS .bashrc contents {{ else if eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\" -}} # Linux .bashrc contents {{ end -}} However, if the differences between the two versions are so large that you'd prefer to use completely separate files in the source state, you can achieve this using a symbolic link template. Create the following files: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/symlink_dot_bashrc.tmpl .bashrc_{{ .chezmoi.os }} ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc_darwin # macOS .bashrc contents ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc_linux # Linux .bashrc contents ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiignore {{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" }} .bashrc_darwin {{ end }} {{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"linux\" }} .bashrc_linux {{ end }} This will make ~/.bashrc a symlink to .bashrc_darwin on darwin and to .bashrc_linux on linux . The .chezmoiignore configuration ensures that only the OS-specific .bashrc_os file will be installed on each OS. Without using symlinks The same thing can be achieved using the include function. ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc.tmpl {{ if eq .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" }} {{ include \".bashrc_darwin\" }} {{ end }} {{ if eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\" }} {{ include \".bashrc_linux\" }} {{ end }}","title":"Manage machine-to-machine differences"},{"location":"user-guide/manage-machine-to-machine-differences/#manage-machine-to-machine-differences","text":"","title":"Manage machine-to-machine differences"},{"location":"user-guide/manage-machine-to-machine-differences/#use-templates","text":"The primary goal of chezmoi is to manage configuration files across multiple machines, for example your personal macOS laptop, your work Ubuntu desktop, and your work Linux laptop.

Templates can be executed directly from the command line, without the need to create a file on disk, with the execute-template command, for example: $ chezmoi execute-template \"{{ .chezmoi.os }}/{{ .chezmoi.arch }}\" This is useful when developing or debugging templates. Some password managers allow you to store complete files. The files can be retrieved with chezmoi's template functions. For example, if you have a file stored in 1Password with the UUID uuid then you can retrieve it with the template: {{- onepasswordDocument \"uuid\" -}} The - s inside the brackets remove any whitespace before or after the template expression, which is useful if your editor has added any newlines. If, after executing the template, the file contents are empty, the target file will be removed. This can be used to ensure that files are only present on certain machines. If you want an empty file to be created anyway, you will need to give it an empty_ prefix.","title":"Use templates"},{"location":"user-guide/manage-machine-to-machine-differences/#ignore-files-or-a-directory-on-different-machines","text":"For coarser-grained control of files and entire directories managed on different machines, or to exclude certain files completely, you can create .chezmoiignore files in the source directory. These specify a list of patterns that chezmoi should ignore, and are interpreted as templates. An example .chezmoiignore file might look like: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiignore README.md {{- if ne .chezmoi.hostname \"work-laptop\" }} .work # only manage .work on work-laptop {{- end }} The use of ne (not equal) is deliberate. What we want to achieve is \"only install .work if hostname is work-laptop \" but chezmoi installs everything by default, so we have to turn the logic around and instead write \"ignore .work unless the hostname is work-laptop \". Patterns can be excluded by prefixing them with a ! , for example: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiignore f* !foo will ignore all files beginning with an f except foo .

The contents of this file are available in templates with the template $NAME . function where $NAME is the name of the file ( . passes the current data to the template code in file.conf ; see https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Actions for details). Then create files for each system, for example Library/Application Support/App/file.conf.tmpl for macOS and dot_config/app/file.conf.tmpl for Linux. Both template files should contain {{- template \"file.conf\" . -}} . Finally, tell chezmoi to ignore files where they are not needed by adding lines to your .chezmoiignore file, for example: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiignore {{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" }} Library/Application Support/App/file.conf {{ end }} {{ if ne .chezmoi.os \"linux\" }} .config/app/file.conf {{ end }}","title":"Handle different file locations on different systems with the same contents"},{"location":"user-guide/manage-machine-to-machine-differences/#use-completely-different-dotfiles-on-different-machines","text":"chezmoi's template functionality allows you to change a file's contents based on any variable.

For example, you can use the hostname of the machine to create different configurations on different machines. chezmoi uses the text/template syntax from Go extended with text template functions from sprig . When reading files from the source state, chezmoi interprets them as a template if either of the following is true: The file name has a .tmpl suffix. The file is in the .chezmoitemplates directory, or a subdirectory of .chezmoitemplates . Template data chezmoi provides a variety of template variables. For a full list, run $ chezmoi data These come from a variety of sources (later data overwrite earlier ones): Variables populated by chezmoi are in .chezmoi , for example .chezmoi.os . Variables created by you in the .chezmoidata.$FORMAT configuration file. The various supported formats (json, toml and yaml) are read in alphabetical order. Variables created by you in the data section of the configuration file. Furthermore, chezmoi provides a variety of functions to retrieve data at runtime from password managers, environment variables, and the filesystem. Creating a template file There are several ways to create a template: When adding a file for the first time, pass the --template argument, for example: $ chezmoi add --template ~/.zshrc When adding a file for the first time, you can pass the --autotemplate argument, which tells chezmoi to make the file as a template and automatically replace variables that chezmoi knows about, for example: $ chezmoi add --autotemplate ~/.zshrc If a file is already managed by chezmoi, but is not a template, you can make it a template by running, for example: $ chezmoi chattr +template ~/.zshrc You can create a template manually in the source directory by giving it a .tmpl extension, for example: $ chezmoi cd $ $EDITOR dot_zshrc.tmpl Templates in .chezmoitemplates must be created manually, for example: $ chezmoi cd $ mkdir -p .chezmoitemplates $ cd .chezmoitemplates $ $EDITOR mytemplate Editing a template file The easiest way to edit a template is to use chezmoi edit , for example: $ chezmoi edit ~/.zshrc This will open the source file for ~/.zshrc in $EDITOR . When you quit the editor, chezmoi will check the template syntax. If you want the changes you make to be immediately applied after you quit the editor, use the --apply option, for example: $ chezmoi edit --apply ~/.zshrc Testing templates Templates can be tested with the chezmoi execute-template command which treats each of its arguments as a template and executes it. This can be useful for testing small fragments of templates, for example: $ chezmoi execute-template '{{ .chezmoi.hostname }}' If there are no arguments, chezmoi execute-template will read the template from the standard input. This can be useful for testing whole files, for example: $ chezmoi cd $ chezmoi execute-template < dot_zshrc.tmpl Template syntax Template actions are written inside double curly brackets, {{ and }} . Actions can be variables, pipelines, or control statements. Text outside actions is copied literally. Variables are written literally, for example: {{ .chezmoi.hostname }} Conditional expressions can be written using if , else if , else , and end , for example: {{ if eq .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" }} # darwin {{ else if eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\" }} # linux {{ else }} # other operating system {{ end }} For a full description of the template syntax, see the text/template documentation . Removing whitespace For formatting reasons you might want to leave some whitespace after or before the template code. This whitespace will remain in the final file, which you might not want. A solution for this is to place a minus sign and a space next to the brackets. So {{- for the left brackets and -}} for the right brackets. Here's an example: HOSTNAME={{- .chezmoi.hostname }} This will result in HOSTNAME=myhostname Notice that this will remove any number of tabs, spaces and even newlines and carriage returns. Debugging templates If there is a mistake in one of your templates and you want to debug it, chezmoi can help you. You can use this subcommand to test and play with the examples in these docs as well. There is a very handy subcommand called execute-template . chezmoi will interpret any data coming from stdin or at the end of the command. It will then interpret all templates and output the result to stdout. For example with the command: $ chezmoi execute-template '{{ .chezmoi.os }}/{{ .chezmoi.arch }}' chezmoi will output the current OS and architecture to stdout. You can also feed the contents of a file to this command by typing: $ cat foo.txt | chezmoi execute-template Simple logic A very useful feature of chezmoi templates is the ability to perform logical operations. # common config export EDITOR=vi # machine-specific configuration {{- if eq .chezmoi.hostname \"work-laptop\" }} # this will only be included in ~/.bashrc on work-laptop {{- end }} In this example chezmoi will look at the hostname of the machine and if that is equal to \"work-laptop\", the text between the if and the end will be included in the result. Boolean functions Function Return value eq Returns true if the first argument is equal to any of the other arguments not Returns the boolean negation of its single argument and Returns the boolean AND of its arguments by returning the first empty argument or the last argument, that is, and x y behaves as if x then y else x . All the arguments are evaluated or Returns the boolean OR of its arguments by returning the first non-empty argument or the last argument, that is, or x y behaves as if x then x else y All the arguments are evaluated Integer functions Function Return value len Returns the integer length of its argument eq Returns the boolean truth of arg1 == arg2 ne Returns the boolean truth of arg1 != arg2 lt Returns the boolean truth of arg1 < arg2 le Returns the boolean truth of arg1 <= arg2 gt Returns the boolean truth of arg1 > arg2 ge Returns the boolean truth of arg1 >= arg2 More complicated logic Up until now, we have only seen if statements that can handle at most two variables. In this part we will see how to create more complicated expressions. You can also create more complicated expressions. The eq command can accept multiple arguments. It will check if the first argument is equal to any of the other arguments. {{ if eq \"foo\" \"foo\" \"bar\" }}hello{{end}} {{ if eq \"foo\" \"bar\" \"foo\" }}hello{{end}} {{ if eq \"foo\" \"bar\" \"bar\" }}hello{{end}} The first two examples will output hello and the last example will output nothing. The operators or and and can also accept multiple arguments. Chaining operators You can perform multiple checks in one if statement. {{ if (and (eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\") (ne .email \"me@home.org\")) }} ... {{ end }} This will check if the operating system is Linux and the configured email is not the home email. The brackets are needed here, because otherwise all the arguments will be give to the and command. This way you can chain as many operators together as you like. Helper functions chezmoi has added multiple helper functions to the text/template syntax. chezmoi includes sprig , an extension to the text/template format that contains many helper functions. Take a look at their documentation for a list. chezmoi adds a few functions of its own as well. Take a look at the reference for complete list. Template variables chezmoi defines a few useful templates variables that depend on the system you are currently on. A list of the variables defined by chezmoi can be found here . There are, however more variables than that. To view the variables available on your system, execute: $ chezmoi data This outputs the variables in JSON format by default. To access the variable chezmoi.kernel.osrelease in a template, use {{ .chezmoi.kernel.osrelease }} This way you can also access the variables you defined yourself. Using .chezmoitemplates Files in the .chezmoitemplates subdirectory are parsed as templates and are available to be included in other templates using the template action with a name equal to their relative path to the .chezmoitemplates directory. By default, such templates will be executed with nil data. If you want to access template variables (e.g. .chezmoi.os ) in the template you must pass the data explicitly. For example: .chezmoitemplates/part.tmpl: {{ if eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\" }} # linux config {{ else }} # non-linux config {{ end }} dot_file.tmpl: {{ template \"part.tmpl\" . }} Using .chezmoitemplates for creating similar files When you have multiple similar files, but they aren't quite the same, you can create a template file in the directory .chezmoitemplates . This template can be inserted in other template files, for example: Create .local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoitemplates/alacritty : some: config fontsize: {{ . }} more: config Notice the file name doesn't have to end in .tmpl , as all files in the directory .chezmoitemplates are interpreted as templates. Create other files using the template ~/.local/share/chezmoi/small-font.yml.tmpl {{- template \"alacritty\" 12 -}} ~/.local/share/chezmoi/big-font.yml.tmpl {{- template \"alacritty\" 18 -}} Here we're calling the shared alacritty template with the font size as the . value passed in. You can test this with chezmoi cat : $ chezmoi cat ~/small-font.yml some: config fontsize: 12 more: config $ chezmoi cat ~/big-font.yml some: config fontsize: 18 more: config Passing multiple arguments In the example above only one arguments is passed to the template. To pass more arguments to the template, you can do it in two ways. Via the config file This method is useful if you want to use the same template arguments multiple times, because you don't specify the arguments every time. Instead you specify them in the file ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml : ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml [data.alacritty.big] fontsize = 18 font = \"DejaVu Serif\" [data.alacritty.small] fontsize = 12 font = \"DejaVu Sans Mono\" Use the variables in ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoitemplates/alacritty : ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoitemplates/alacritty some: config fontsize: {{ .fontsize }} font: {{ .font }} more: config And connect them with ~/.local/share/chezmoi/small-font.yml.tmpl : ~/.local/share/chezmoi/small-font.yml.tmpl {{- template \"alacritty\" .alacritty.small -}} At the moment, this means that you'll have to duplicate the alacritty data in the config file on every machine, but a feature will be added to avoid this. By passing a dictionary Using the same alacritty configuration as above, you can pass the arguments to it with a dictionary, for example ~/.local/share/chezmoi/small-font.yml.tmpl : ~/.local/share/chezmoi/small-font.yml.tmpl {{- template \"alacritty\" dict \"fontsize\" 12 \"font\" \"DejaVu Sans Mono\" -}}","title":"Templating"},{"location":"user-guide/templating/#templating","text":"","title":"Templating"},{"location":"user-guide/templating/#introduction","text":"Templates are used to change the contents of a file depending on the environment.

The scripts can either run every time you run chezmoi apply , or only when their contents have changed. In verbose mode, the script's contents will be printed before executing it. In dry-run mode, the script is not executed. Scripts are any file in the source directory with the prefix run_ , and are executed in alphabetical order. Scripts that should only be run if they have not been run before have the prefix run_once_ . Scripts that should be run whenever their contents change have the run_onchange_ prefix. Scripts break chezmoi's declarative approach, and as such should be used sparingly. Any script should be idempotent, even run_once_ and run_onchange_ scripts. Scripts are normally run while chezmoi updates your dotfiles. To configure scripts to run before or after your dotfiles are updated use the before_ and after_ attributes respectively, e.g. run_once_before_install-password-manager.sh . Scripts must be created manually in the source directory, typically by running chezmoi cd and then creating a file with a run_ prefix. There is no need to set the executable bit on the script, as chezmoi will set the executable bit before executing the script. Scripts with the suffix .tmpl are treated as templates, with the usual template variables available. If, after executing the template, the result is only whitespace or an empty string, then the script is not executed. This is useful for disabling scripts. When chezmoi executes a script, it first generates the script contents in a file in a temporary directory with the executable bit set, and then executes the contents with exec(3) . Consequently, the script's contents must either include a #! line or be an executable binary. Set environment variables You can set extra environment variables for your scripts in the scriptEnv section of your config file. For example, to set the $MY_VAR environment variable to my_value , specify: ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml [scriptEnv] MY_VAR = \"my_value\" Note By default, chezmoi diff will print the contents of scripts that would be run by chezmoi apply . To exclude scripts from the output of chezmoi diff , set diff.exclude in your configuration file, for example: ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml [diff] exclude = [ \"scripts\" ] Similarly, chezmoi status will print the names of the scripts that it will execute with the status R . This can similarly disabled by setting status.exclude to [\"scripts\"] in your configuration file. Install packages with scripts Change to the source directory and create a file called run_once_install-packages.sh : $ chezmoi cd $ $EDITOR run_once_install-packages.sh In this file create your package installation script, e.g. #!/bin/sh sudo apt install ripgrep The next time you run chezmoi apply or chezmoi update this script will be run. As it has the run_once_ prefix, it will not be run again unless its contents change, for example if you add more packages to be installed. This script can also be a template. For example, if you create run_once_install-packages.sh.tmpl with the contents: ~/.local/share/chezmoi/run_once_install-packages.sh.tmpl {{ if eq .chezmoi.os \"linux\" -}} #!/bin/sh sudo apt install ripgrep {{ else if eq .chezmoi.os \"darwin\" -}} #!/bin/sh brew install ripgrep {{ end -}} This will install ripgrep on both Debian/Ubuntu Linux systems and macOS. Run a script when the contents of another file changes chezmoi's run_ scripts are run every time you run chezmoi apply , whereas run_once_ scripts are run only when their contents have changed, after executing them as templates. You can use this to cause a run_once_ script to run when the contents of another file has changed by including a checksum of the other file's contents in the script. For example, if your dconf settings are stored in dconf.ini in your source directory then you can make chezmoi apply only load them when the contents of dconf.ini has changed by adding the following script as run_once_dconf-load.sh.tmpl : ~/.local/share/chezmoi/run_once_dconf-load.sh.tmpl #!/bin/bash # dconf.ini hash: {{ include \"dconf.ini\" | sha256sum }} dconf load / < {{ joinPath .chezmoi.sourceDir \"dconf.ini\" | quote }} As the SHA256 sum of dconf.ini is included in a comment in the script, the contents of the script will change whenever the contents of dconf.ini are changed, so chezmoi will re-run the script whenever the contents of dconf.ini change. In this example you should also add dconf.ini to .chezmoiignore so chezmoi does not create dconf.ini in your home directory.

No. chezmoi edit is a convenience command that has a couple of useful features, but you don't have to use it. You can also run chezmoi cd and then just edit the files in the source state directly. After saving an edited file you can run chezmoi diff to check what effect the changes would have, and run chezmoi apply if you're happy with them. If there are inconsistencies that you want to keep, then chezmoi merge-all will help you resolve any differences. chezmoi edit provides the following useful features: The arguments to chezmoi edit are the files in their target location, so you don't have to think about source state attributes and your editor's syntax highlighting will work. If the dotfile is encrypted in the source state, then chezmoi edit will decrypt it to a private directory, open that file in your $EDITOR , and then re-encrypt the file when you quit your editor. This makes encryption transparent. With the --diff and --apply options you can see what would change and apply those changes without having to run chezmoi diff or chezmoi apply . If you have configured git auto commits or git auto pushes then chezmoi edit will create commits and push them for you. If you chose to edit files in the source state and you're using VIM then github.com/alker0/chezmoi.vim gives you syntax highlighting, however you edit your files. Besides using the plugin, you can use modeline to tell VIM the correct filetype. For example, put # vim: filetype=zsh at the top of dot_zshrc , and VIM will treat dot_zshrc as zsh file. Why doesn't chezmoi use symlinks like GNU Stow? Symlinks are first class citizens in chezmoi: chezmoi supports creating them, updating them, removing them, and even more advanced features not found in other dotfile managers like having the same symlink point to different targets on different machines by using a template. With chezmoi, you only use a symlink where you really need a symlink, in contrast to some other dotfile managers (e.g. GNU Stow) which require the use of symlinks as a layer of indirection between a dotfile's location (which can be anywhere in your home directory) and a dotfile's content (which needs to be in a centralized directory that you manage with version control). chezmoi solves this problem in a different way. Instead of using a symlink to redirect from the dotfile's location to the centralized directory, chezmoi generates the dotfile as a regular file in its final location from the contents of the centralized directory. This approach allows chezmoi to provide features that are not possible when using symlinks, for example having files that are encrypted, executable, private, or templates. There is nothing special about dotfiles managed by chezmoi whereas dotfiles managed with GNU Stow are special because they're actually symlinks to somewhere else. The only advantage to using GNU Stow-style symlinks is that changes that you make to the dotfile's contents in the centralized directory are immediately visible whenever you save them, whereas chezmoi currently requires you to pass the --watch flag to chezmoi edit or set edit.watch to true in your configuration file. If you really want to use symlinks, then chezmoi provides a symlink mode which uses symlinks where possible. This configures chezmoi to work like GNU Stow and have it create a set of symlinks back to a central directory, but this currently requires a bit of manual work (as described in #167 ). chezmoi might get some automation to help (see #886 for example) but it does need some convincing use cases that demonstrate that a symlink from a dotfile's location to its contents in a central directory is better than just having the correct dotfile contents. What are the limitations of chezmoi's symlink mode? In symlink mode chezmoi replaces targets with symlinks to the source directory if the target is a regular file and is not encrypted, executable, private, or a template. Symlinks cannot be used for encrypted files because the source state contains the ciphertext, not the plaintext. Symlinks cannot be used for executable files as the executable bit would need to be set on the file in the source directory and chezmoi uses only regular files and directories in its source state for portability across operating systems. This may change in the future. Symlinks cannot be used for private files because git does not persist group and world permission bits. Symlinks cannot be used for templated files because the source state contains the template, not the result of executing the template. Symlinks cannot be used for entire directories because of chezmoi's use of attributes in the filename mangles entries in the directory, directories might have the exact_ attribute and contain empty files, and the directory's entries might not be usable with symlinks. In symlink mode, running chezmoi add does not immediately replace the targets with a symlink. You must run chezmoi apply to create the symlinks. Why does chezmoi use weird filenames? There are a number of criticisms of how chezmoi uses filenames: The long source file names are weird and verbose. Not all possible file permissions can be represented. Everything is in a single directory, which can end up containing many entries. chezmoi's decision to store metadata in filenames is a deliberate, practical, compromise. Firstly, almost all programs store metadata in filenames: the filename's extension. chezmoi extends the filename to storing metadata in attributes in the filename's prefix as well. The dot_ attribute makes it transparent which dotfiles are managed by chezmoi and which files are ignored by chezmoi. chezmoi ignores all files and directories that start with . so no special whitelists are needed for version control systems and their control files (e.g. .git and .gitignore ). chezmoi needs per-file metadata to know how to interpret the source file's contents, for example to know when the source file is a template or if the file's contents are encrypted. By storing this metadata in the filename, the metadata is unambiguously associated with a single file and adding, updating, or removing a single file touches only a single file in the source state. Changes to the metadata (e.g. chezmoi chattr +template $TARGET ) are simple file renames and isolated to the affected file. If chezmoi were to, say, use a common configuration file listing which files were templates and/or encrypted, then changes to any file would require updates to the common configuration file. Automating updates to configuration files requires a round trip (read config file, update config, write config) and it is not always possible preserve comments and formatting. chezmoi's attributes of executable_ , private_ , and readonly_ allow the file permissions 0o644 , 0o755 , 0o600 , 0o700 , 0o444 , 0o555 , 0o400 , and 0o500 to be represented. Directories can only have permissions 0o755 , 0o700 , or 0o500 . In practice, these cover all permissions typically used for dotfiles. If this does cause a genuine problem for you, please open an issue on GitHub . File permissions and modes like executable_ , private_ , readonly_ , and symlink_ could also be stored in the filesystem, rather than in the filename. However, this requires the permissions to be preserved and handled by the underlying version control system and filesystem. chezmoi provides first-class support for Windows, where the executable_ and private_ attributes have no direct equivalents and symbolic links are not always permitted. By using regular files and directories, chezmoi avoids variations in the operating system, version control system, and filesystem making it both more robust and more portable. chezmoi uses a 1:1 mapping between entries in the source state and entries in the target state. This mapping is bi-directional and unambiguous. However, this also means that dotfiles that in the same directory in the target state must be in the same directory in the source state. In particular, every entry managed by chezmoi in the root of your home directory has a corresponding entry in the root of your source directory, which can mean that you end up with a lot of entries in the root of your source directory. This can be mitigated by using .chezmoiroot file. If chezmoi were to permit, say, multiple separate source directories (so you could, say, put dot_bashrc in a bash/ subdirectory, and dot_vimrc in a vim/ subdirectory, but have chezmoi apply map these to ~/.bashrc and ~/.vimrc in the root of your home directory) then the mapping between source and target states is no longer bidirectional nor unambiguous, which significantly increases complexity and requires more user interaction. For example, if both bash/dot_bashrc and vim/dot_bashrc exist, what should be the contents of ~/.bashrc ? If you run chezmoi add ~/.zshrc , should dot_zshrc be stored in the source bash/ directory, the source vim/ directory, or somewhere else? How does the user communicate their preferences? chezmoi has many users and any changes to the source state representation must be backwards-compatible. In summary, chezmoi's source state representation is a compromise with both advantages and disadvantages. Changes to the representation will be considered, but must meet the following criteria, in order of importance: Be fully backwards-compatible for existing users. Fix a genuine problem encountered in practice. Be independent of the underlying operating system, version control system, and filesystem. Not add significant extra complexity to the user interface or underlying implementation. Can chezmoi support multiple sources or multiple source states? With some dotfile managers, dotfiles can be distributed across multiple directories or even multiple repos. For example, the user might have one directory per application, or separate repos for home and work configurations, or even separate git submodules for different applications. These can be considered multiple sources of truth for the target state. This, however, comes with complications: Multiple sources of truth complicate the user interface. When running chezmoi add $FILE , which source should $FILE be added to? Multiple sources of truth do not compose easily if target files overlap. For example, if you have two sources, both of which need to set an environment variable in .bashrc , how do you handle this when both, only one, or neither source might be activated? What if the sources are mutually exclusive, e.g. if the VIM source and the Emacs source both want to set the $EDITOR environment variable? Multiple sources of truth are not always independent. Related to the previous point, consider a source that adds an applications's configuration files and shell completions. Should the shell completions be part of the applications's source or of the shell's source? chezmoi instead makes the opinionated choice to use a single source of truth, i.e. a single branch in a single git repo. Using a single source of truth avoids the inherent complexity and ambiguity of multiple sources. chezmoi provides mechanisms like templates (for minor differences), .chezmoiignore (for controlling the presence or otherwise of complete files and directories), and password manager integration (so secrets never need to be stored in a repo) handle machine-to-machine differences. Externals make it easy to pull in dotfiles from third-party sources. That said, if you are keen to use multiple sources of truth with chezmoi, you have a number of options with some scripting around chezmoi. Firstly, you can run chezmoi apply with different arguments to the --config and --source flags which will apply to the same destination. So that you only have to type one command you can wrap this in a shell function, for example: chezmoi-apply () { chezmoi apply --config ~/.config/chezmoi-home/chezmoi.toml \\ --source ~/.local/share/chezmoi-home && \\ chezmoi apply --config ~/.config/chezmoi-work/chezmoi.toml \\ --source ~/.local/share/chezmoi-work } If you want to generate multiple configuration files with chezmoi init then you will need the --config-path flag. For more advanced use, use the --destination , --cache , and --persistent-state flags. Secondly, you can assemble a single source state from multiple sources and then use chezmoi apply . For example, if you have multiple source states in subdirectories of ~/.dotfiles : #!/bin/bash # create a combined source state in a temporary directory combined_source = \" $( mktemp -d ) \" # remove the temporary source state on exit trap 'rm -rf -- \"${combined_source}\"' INT TERM # copy files from multiple sources into the temporary source state for source in $HOME /.dotfiles/* ; do cp -r \" ${ source } \" /* \" ${ combined_source } \" done # apply the temporary source state chezmoi apply --source \" ${ combined_source } \" Thirdly, you can use a run_ script to invoke a second instance of chezmoi, as used by @felipecrs . Why does chezmoi cd spawn a shell instead of just changing directory? chezmoi cd spawns a shell because it is not possible for a program to change the working directory of its parent process. You can add a shell function instead: chezmoi-cd () { cd $( chezmoi source-path ) } Typing chezmoi-cd will then change the directory of your current shell to chezmoi's source directory. Why are the prompt* functions only available in config file templates? chezmoi regularly needs to execute templates to determine the target contents of files. For example, templates are executed for the apply , diff , and status commands, amongst many others. Having to interactively respond each time would quickly become tiresome. Therefore, chezmoi only provides these functions when generating a config file from a config file template (e.g. when you run chezmoi init or chezmoi --init apply ). Why not use Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Salt, or similar to manage my dotfiles instead? Whole system management tools are more than capable of managing your dotfiles, but they are large systems that entail several disadvantages. Compared to whole system management tools, chezmoi offers: Small, focused feature set designed for dotfiles. There's simply less to learn with chezmoi compared to whole system management tools. Easy installation and execution on every platform, without root access. Installing chezmoi requires only copying a single binary file with no external dependencies. Executing chezmoi just involves running the binary. In contrast, installing and running a whole system management tool typically requires installing a scripting language runtime, several packages, and running a system service, all typically requiring root access. chezmoi's focus and simple installation means that it runs almost everywhere: from tiny ARM-based Linux systems to Windows desktops, from inside lightweight containers to FreeBSD-based virtual machines in the cloud. Can I use chezmoi to manage files outside my home directory? In practice, yes, you can, but this usage is strongly discouraged beyond using your system's package manager to install the packages you need. chezmoi is designed to operate on your home directory, and is explicitly not a full system configuration management tool. That said, there are some ways to have chezmoi manage a few files outside your home directory. chezmoi's scripts can execute arbitrary commands, so you can use a run_ script that is run every time you run chezmoi apply , to, for example: Make the target file outside your home directory a symlink to a file managed by chezmoi in your home directory. Copy a file managed by chezmoi inside your home directory to the target file. Execute a template with chezmoi execute-template --output=$FILENAME template where $FILENAME is outside the target directory. chezmoi executes all scripts as the user executing chezmoi, so you may need to add extra privilege elevation commands like sudo or PowerShell start -verb runas -wait to your script. chezmoi, by default, operates on your home directory but this can be overridden with the --destination command line flag or by specifying destDir in your config file, and could even be the root directory ( / or C:\\ ). This allows you, in theory, to use chezmoi to manage any file in your filesystem, but this usage is extremely strongly discouraged. If your needs extend beyond modifying a handful of files outside your target system, then existing configuration management tools like Puppet , Chef , Ansible , and Salt are much better suited - and of course can be called from a chezmoi run_ script. Put your Puppet Manifests, Chef Recipes, Ansible Modules, and Salt Modules in a directory ignored by .chezmoiignore so they do not pollute your home directory. What inspired chezmoi? chezmoi was inspired by Puppet , but was created because Puppet is an overkill for managing your personal configuration files. The focus of chezmoi will always be personal home directory management. If your needs grow beyond that, switch to a whole system configuration management tool. Where does the name \"chezmoi\" come from? \"chezmoi\" splits to \"chez moi\" and pronounced /\u0283e\u026a mwa/ (shay-moi) meaning \"at my house\" in French. It's seven letters long, which is an appropriate length for a command that is only run occasionally.

Execute a template with chezmoi execute-template --output=$FILENAME template where $FILENAME is outside the target directory. chezmoi executes all scripts as the user executing chezmoi, so you may need to add extra privilege elevation commands like sudo or PowerShell start -verb runas -wait to your script. chezmoi, by default, operates on your home directory but this can be overridden with the --destination command line flag or by specifying destDir in your config file, and could even be the root directory ( / or C:\\ ). This allows you, in theory, to use chezmoi to manage any file in your filesystem, but this usage is extremely strongly discouraged. If your needs extend beyond modifying a handful of files outside your target system, then existing configuration management tools like Puppet , Chef , Ansible , and Salt are much better suited - and of course can be called from a chezmoi run_ script. Put your Puppet Manifests, Chef Recipes, Ansible Modules, and Salt Modules in a directory ignored by .chezmoiignore so they do not pollute your home directory.","title":"Can I use chezmoi to manage files outside my home directory?"},{"location":"user-guide/frequently-asked-questions/design/#what-inspired-chezmoi","text":"chezmoi was inspired by Puppet , but was created because Puppet is an overkill for managing your personal configuration files.

Run: $ chezmoi doctor Anything ok is fine, anything warning is only a problem if you want to use the related feature, and anything error indicates a definite problem. A specific command is not behaving as I expect. How can I debug it? The --verbose flag makes chezmoi to print extra information about what it is doing. The --debug flag makes chezmoi print very detailed step by step information. The output of chezmoi diff is broken and does not contain color. What could be wrong? By default, chezmoi's diff output includes ANSI color escape sequences (e.g. ESC[37m ) and is piped into your pager (by default less ). chezmoi assumes that your pager passes through the ANSI color escape sequences, as configured on many systems, but not all. If your pager does not pass through ANSI color escape sequences then you will see monochrome diff output with uninterpreted ANSI color escape sequences. This can typically by fixed by setting the environment variable $ export LESS = -R which instructs less to display \"raw\" control characters via the -R / --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS option. You can also set the pager configuration variable in your config file, for example: ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml pager = \"less -R\" If you have set a different pager (via the pager configuration variable or PAGER environment variable) then you must ensure that it passes through raw control characters. Alternatively, you can use the --color=false option to chezmoi to disable colors or the --no-pager option to chezmoi to disable the pager. Why do I get a blank buffer or empty file when running chezmoi edit ? In this case, chezmoi edit typically prints a warning like: chezmoi: warning: $EDITOR $TMPDIR/$FILENAME: returned in less than 1s chezmoi edit performs a bit of magic to improve the experience of editing files in the source state by invoking your editor with filenames in a temporary directory that look like filenames in your home directory. What's happening here is that your editor command is exiting immediately, so chezmoi thinks you've finished editing and so removes the temporary directory, but actually your editor command has forked a edit process in the background, and that edit process opens a now non-existent file. To fix this you have to configure your editor command to remain in the foreground until you have finished editing the file, so chezmoi knows when to remove the temporary directory. VIM VSCode Pass the -f flag, e.g. by setting the edit.flags configuration variable to [\"-f\"] , or by setting the EDITOR environment variable to include the -f flag, e.g. export EDITOR=\"vim -f\" . Pass the --wait flag, e.g. by setting the edit.flags configuration variable to [\"--wait\"] or by setting the EDITOR environment variable to include the --wait flag, e.g. export EDITOR=\"code --wait\" . The \"bit of magic\" that chezmoi edit performs includes: chezmoi edit makes the filename opened by your editor more closely match the target filename, which can help your editor choose the correct syntax highlighting. For example, if you run chezmoi edit ~/.zshrc , your editor is be opened with $TMPDIR/.zshrc but you'll actually be editing ~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_zshrc . Under the hood, chezmoi creates a hardlink in a temporary directory to the file in your source directory, so even though your editor thinks it's editing .zshrc , it is really editing dot_zshrc in your source directory. If the source file is encrypted then chezmoi edit transparently decrypts and re-encrypts the file for you. Specifically, chezmoi decrypts the file into a private temporary directory and open your editor with the decrypted file, and re-encrypts the file when you exit your editor. If the source file is a template, then chezmoi edit preserves the .tmpl extension. chezmoi makes ~/.ssh/config group writeable. How do I stop this? By default, chezmoi uses your system's umask when creating files. On most systems the default umask is 022 but some systems use 002 , which means that files and directories are group writeable by default. You can override this for chezmoi by setting the umask configuration variable in your configuration file, for example: ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml umask = 0 o022 Note This will apply to all files and directories that chezmoi manages and will ensure that none of them are group writeable. It is not currently possible to control group write permissions for individual files or directories. Please open an issue on GitHub if you need this. chezmoi reports chezmoi: user: lookup userid NNNNN: input/output error This is likely because the chezmoi binary you are using was statically compiled with musl and the machine you are running on uses LDAP or NIS. The immediate fix is to use a package built for your distribution (e.g a .deb or .rpm ) which is linked against glibc and includes LDAP/NIS support instead of the statically-compiled binary. If the problem still persists, then please open an issue on GitHub . chezmoi reports chezmoi: timeout or chezmoi: timeout obtaining persistent state lock chezmoi will report this when it is unable to lock its persistent state ( ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoistate.boltdb ), typically because another instance of chezmoi is currently running and holding the lock. This can happen, for example, if you have a run_ script that invokes chezmoi , or are running chezmoi in another window. Under the hood, chezmoi uses bbolt which permits multiple simultaneous readers, but only one writer (with no readers). Commands that take a write lock include add , apply , edit , forget , import , init , state , unmanage , and update . Commands that take a read lock include diff , status , and verify . chezmoi reports chezmoi: fork/exec /tmp/XXXXXXXXXX.XX: permission denied when executing a script This error occurs when your temporary directory is mounted with the noexec option. As chezmoi scripts can be templates, encrypted, or both, chezmoi needs to write the final script's contents to a file so that it can be executed by the operating system. By default, chezmoi will use $TMPDIR for this. You can change the temporary directory into which chezmoi writes and executes scripts with the scriptTempDir configuration variable. For example, to use a subdirectory of your home directory you can use: ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml scriptTempDir = \"~/tmp\" chezmoi reports chezmoi: mkdir xxxxx: no such file or directory when trying to manage file or directory This error occurs when you try to add directory/file to be managed via chezmoi but the same directory is only listed in .chezmoiexternal.$FORMAT . A workaround can be applied in a such case via manually creating import directory in chezmoi source directory (typically ~/.local/share/chezmoi ) and create .keep file. For example, if .chezmoiexternal.toml has the configuration: [\".config/nvim\"] type = \"git-repo\" url = \"https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad.git\" refreshPeriod = \"168h\" [\".config/nvim\".pull] args = [ \"--ff-only\" ] Now chezmoi add ~/.config/direnv/direnvrc will raise the error: chezmoi: mkdir /home/<user>/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_config/direnv: no such file or directory But the workaround can be applied: $ chezmoi cd $ mkdir -p dot_config/ $ touch dot_config/.keep Now once that done chezmoi add ~/.config/direnv/direnvrc should work.

This is not a bug in chezmoi and there is nothing that chezmoi can do about this. However, there are two workarounds: Firstly, you can use alternatives to shell redirection. For standard input: $ chezmoi $COMMAND < $FILENAME # fails $ cat $FILENAME | chezmoi $COMMAND # succeeds For standard output: $ chezmoi $COMMAND > $FILENAME # fails $ chezmoi $COMMAND -o $FILENAME # succeeds $ chezmoi $COMMAND --output = $FILENAME # succeeds $ chezmoi $COMMAND | tee $FILENAME >/dev/null # succeeds Secondly, you can install chezmoi with any of the many supported install methods instead of snap. chezmoi reports fork/exec ...: no such file or directory when running scripts on Termux You are likely using a hardcoded script interpreter in the shebang line of your scripts, e.g. #!/bin/bash /bin/bash does not exist on Termux.

There are five popular approaches: Use chezmoi edit $FILE . This will open the source file for $FILE in your editor, including . For extra ease, use chezmoi edit --apply $FILE to apply the changes when you quit your editor, and chezmoi edit --watch $FILE to apply the changes whenever you save the file. Use chezmoi cd and edit the files in the source directory directly. Run chezmoi diff to see what changes would be made, and chezmoi apply to make the changes. If your editor supports opening directories, run chezmoi edit with no arguments to open the source directory. Edit the file in your home directory, and then either re-add it by running chezmoi add $FILE or chezmoi re-add . Edit the file in your home directory, and then merge your changes with source state by running chezmoi merge $FILE . Note re-add doesn't work with templates. What are the consequences of \"bare\" modifications to the target files? If my .zshrc is managed by chezmoi and I edit ~/.zshrc without using chezmoi edit , what happens? Until you run chezmoi apply your modified ~/.zshrc will remain in place. When you run chezmoi apply chezmoi will detect that ~/.zshrc has changed since chezmoi last wrote it and prompt you what to do. You can resolve differences with a merge tool by running chezmoi merge ~/.zshrc . How can I tell what dotfiles in my home directory aren't managed by chezmoi? Is there an easy way to have chezmoi manage a subset of them? chezmoi unmanaged will list everything not managed by chezmoi. You can add entire directories with chezmoi add . How can I tell what dotfiles in my home directory are currently managed by chezmoi? chezmoi managed will list everything managed by chezmoi. If there's a mechanism in place for the above, is there also a way to tell chezmoi to ignore specific files or groups of files (e.g. by directory name or by glob)? By default, chezmoi ignores everything that you haven't explicitly added. If you have files in your source directory that you don't want added to your destination directory when you run chezmoi apply add their names to a file called .chezmoiignore in the source state. Patterns are supported, and you can change what's ignored from machine to machine. The full usage and syntax is described in the reference manual . If the target already exists, but is \"behind\" the source, can chezmoi be configured to preserve the target version before replacing it with one derived from the source? Yes. Run chezmoi add will update the source state with the target. To see diffs of what would change, without actually changing anything, use chezmoi diff . Once I've made a change to the source directory, how do I commit it? You have several options: chezmoi cd opens a shell in the source directory, where you can run your usual version control commands, like git add and git commit . chezmoi git runs git in the source directory and pass extra arguments to the command. If you're passing any flags, you'll need to use -- to prevent chezmoi from consuming them, for example chezmoi git -- commit -m \"Update dotfiles\" . You can configure chezmoi to automatically commit and push changes to your source state, as described in the how-to guide . I've made changes to both the destination state and the source state that I want to keep. How can I keep them both? chezmoi merge will open a merge tool to resolve differences between the source state, target state, and destination state. Copy the changes you want to keep in to the source state. Can I store/share my shell history with chezmoi? Not easily. chezmoi's only shared state between machines is your git repo, and creating a commit every time a command is entered would quickly become cumbersome.

For example, if the output is: { \"id\" : \"$UUID\" , \"title\" : \"$TITLE\" , \"version\" : 2 , \"vault\" : { \"id\" : \"$vaultUUID\" }, \"category\" : \"LOGIN\" , \"last_edited_by\" : \"$userUUID\" , \"created_at\" : \"2010-08-23T13:18:43Z\" , \"updated_at\" : \"2014-07-20T04:40:11Z\" , \"fields\" : [ { \"id\" : \"username\" , \"type\" : \"STRING\" , \"purpose\" : \"USERNAME\" , \"label\" : \"username\" , \"value\" : \"$USERNAME\" }, { \"id\" : \"password\" , \"type\" : \"CONCEALED\" , \"purpose\" : \"PASSWORD\" , \"label\" : \"password\" , \"value\" : \"$PASSWORD\" , \"password_details\" : { \"strength\" : \"FANTASTIC\" , \"history\" : [] } } ], \"urls\" : [ { \"primary\" : true , \"href\" : \"$URL\" } ] } Then you can access the password field with the syntax {{ (index (onepassword \"$UUID\").fields 1).value }} or: {{ range (onepassword \"$UUID\").fields -}} {{ if and (eq .label \"password\") (eq .purpose \"PASSWORD\") -}} {{ .value -}} {{ end -}} {{ end }} Info 1Password CLI 1.x returns a simpler structure: { \"uuid\" : \"$UUID\" , \"details\" : { \"password\" : \"$PASSWORD\" } } This allows for the syntax: {{ (onepassword \"$UUID\").details.password }} onepasswordDetailsFields returns a reworked version of the structure that allows the fields to be queried by key: { \"password\" : { \"id\" : \"password\" , \"label\" : \"password\" , \"password_details\" : { \"history\" : [], \"strength\" : \"FANTASTIC\" }, \"purpose\" : \"PASSWORD\" , \"type\" : \"CONCEALED\" , \"value\" : \"$PASSWORD\" }, \"username\" : { \"id\" : \"username\" , \"label\" : \"username\" , \"purpose\" : \"USERNAME\" , \"type\" : \"STRING\" , \"value\" : \"$USERNAME\" } } {{- (onepasswordDetailsFields \"$UUID\").password.value }} Additional fields may be obtained with onePasswordItemFields ; not all objects in 1Password have item fields. This can be tested with: $ chezmoi execute-template \"{{ onepasswordItemFields \\\" $UUID \\\" | toJson }}\" | jq . Note The extra - after the opening {{ and before the closing }} instructs the template language to remove any whitespace before and after the substitution.
