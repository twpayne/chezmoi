	// Manually updating the secret value by calling PutSecretValue or UpdateSecret is

	AutomaticallyAfterDays *int64

	// The length of the rotation window in hours, for example 3h for a three hour

	Duration *string

	// A cron() or rate() expression that defines the schedule for rotating your
	// secret. Secrets Manager rotation schedules use UTC time zone. Secrets Manager
	// rotates your secret any time during a rotation window. Secrets Manager rate()
	// expressions represent the interval in hours or days that you want to rotate your
	// secret, for example rate(12 hours) or rate(10 days) . You can rotate a secret as
	// often as every four hours. If you use a rate() expression, the rotation window
	// starts at midnight. For a rate in hours, the default rotation window closes
	// after one hour. For a rate in days, the default rotation window closes at the
	// end of the day. You can set the Duration to change the rotation window. The
	// rotation window must not extend into the next UTC day or into the next rotation
	// window. You can use a cron() expression to create a rotation schedule that is
	// more detailed than a rotation interval. For more information, including
	// examples, see Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_schedule.html)
