# Testing

chezmoi uses multiple levels of testing:

1. Unit testing, using [`testing`](https://pkg.go.dev/testing),  and
   [`github.com/alecthomas/assert/v2`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/alecthomas/assert/v2),
   tests that functions and small components behave as expected for a wide range
   of inputs, especially edge cases. These are generally found in
   `internal/chezmoi/*_test.go`.

2. Filesystem integration tests, using `testing` and
   [`github.com/twpayne/go-vfs/v5`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/twpayne/go-vfs/v4),
   test chezmoi's effects on the filesystem. This include some tests in
   `internal/chezmoi/*_test.go`, and higher level command tests in
   `internal/cmd/*cmd_test.go`.

3. High-level integration tests using
   [`github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript)
   are in `internal/cmd/testdata/scripts/*.txtar` and are run by
   `internal/cmd/main_test.go`.

4. Linux distribution and OS tests run the full test suite using Docker for
   different Linux distributions (in `assets/docker`) and Vagrant for different
   OSes (in `assets/vagrant`). Windows tests are run in GitHub Actions.
