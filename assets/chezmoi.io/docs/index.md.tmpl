## What does chezmoi do?

chezmoi helps you manage your personal configuration files (dotfiles, like
`~/.gitconfig`) across multiple machines.

chezmoi provides many features beyond symlinking or using a bare git repo
including:

* templates (to handle small differences between machines)
* password manager support (to store your secrets securely)
* importing files from archives (great for shell and editor plugins)
* full file encryption (using gpg or age)
* running scripts (to handle everything else)

With chezmoi, pronounced /ʃeɪ mwa/ (shay-mwa), you can install chezmoi and your
dotfiles from your GitHub dotfiles repo on a new, empty machine with a single
command:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

As well as the `curl | sh` installation, you can [install chezmoi with your
favorite package manager](site:install).

Updating your dotfiles on any machine is a single command:

```sh
chezmoi update
```

chezmoi runs on all popular operating systems, is distributed as a single
statically-linked binary with no dependencies, and does not require root access.
