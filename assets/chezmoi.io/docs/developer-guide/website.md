# Website

The [website][website] is generated with [Material for MkDocs][material] from
the contents of the `assets/chezmoi.io/docs/` directory. It is hosted by
[GitHub pages][pages] from the [`gh-pages` branch][branch].

To build the website locally, Go 1.24 (or later) and [uv][uv] 0.5.0 (or later)
must be installed. Python 3.10 (or later) is required, but may be installed with
`uv`:

!!! note ""

    If Python 3.10 (or later) is not currently installed, install it with `uv`:

    ```sh
    uv python install 3.10
    ```

Install the dependencies (the `--frozen` is optional but recommended):

```sh
uv sync --frozen
```

Test the website locally by running:

```sh
uv run task serve-docs
```

and visiting [http://127.0.0.1:8000/][serve].

## Maintainers

The website is automatically deployed when new releases are created, but manual
deployments can be triggered by maintainers with appropriate access using:

```sh
uv run task mkdocs gh-deploy
```
