# Contributing changes

Bug reports, bug fixes, and documentation improvements are always welcome.
Please [open an issue][issue] or [create a pull request][pr] with your report,
fix, or improvement.

If you want to make a more significant change, please first
[open an issue][issue] to discuss the change that you want to make. Dave Cheney
gives a [good rationale][rationale] as to why this is important.

All changes are made via pull requests. In your pull request, please make sure
that:

* All existing tests pass. You can ensure this by running `make test`.

* There are appropriate additional tests that demonstrate that your PR works as
  intended.

* The documentation is updated, if necessary. For new features you should add an
  entry in `assets/chezmoi.io/docs/user-guide/` and a complete description in
  `assets/chezmoi.io/docs/reference/`. See the [website][website] for
  instructions on how to build and view a local version of the documentation. By
  default, chezmoi will panic if a flag is undocumented or a long help is
  missing for a command. You can disable this panic during development by
  setting the environment variable `CHEZMOIDEV` to `ignoreflags=1,ignorehelp=1`.
  Once you have documented the command and its flags, run
  `make generate` to generate the embedded
  documentation.

* All generated files are up to date. You can ensure this by running `make
  generate` and including any modified files in your commit.

* The code is correctly formatted. You can ensure this by running `make format`.

* The code passes [`golangci-lint`][golangci-lint]. You can ensure this by
  running `make lint`.

* The commit messages adhere to the [conventional commits specification][commits],
  with the following additional requirements:

      * The first character of the commit message is uppercase, e.g:

          ```text
          chore: Fix typo in test
          ```

        The purpose of this is to maintain consistency in chezmoi's release
        notes, which are generated directly from the commit messages.

      * The commits do not have scopes (e.g. `chore(scope): Message` is invalid).

    The following criteria can be used to determine the commit type:

      * `fix`: bug fixes in chezmoi code
      * `feat`: extending an existing feature or adding a new feature
      * `docs`: adding to or updating the documentation
      * `chore`: small changes, such as fixing a typo, correcting grammar
        (including in documentation), or anything not covered by the above

    Examples can be found in the [commit history][history].

* Commits are logically separate, with no merge or "fixup" commits.

* The branch applies cleanly to `master`.
