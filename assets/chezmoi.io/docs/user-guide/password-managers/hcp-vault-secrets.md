# HCP Vault Secrets

chezmoi includes support for [HCP Vault Secrets][secrets] using the `vlt` CLI to
expose data through the `hcpVaultSecret` and `hcpVaultSecretJson` template
functions.

Log in using:

```sh
vlt login
```

The output of the `vlt secrets get --plaintext $SECRET_NAME` is available as the
`hcpVaultSecret` function, for example:

```text
{{ hcpVaultSecret "secret_name" "application_name" "project_id" "organization_id" }}
```

You can set the default values for the application name, project ID, and
organization ID in your config file, for example:

```toml title="~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml"
[hcpVaultSecrets]
    organizationId = "bf479eab-a292-4b46-92df-e22f5c47eadc"
    projectId = "5907a2fa-d26a-462a-8705-74dfe967e87d"
    applicationName = "my-application"
```

With these default values, you can omit them in the call to `hcpVaultSecret`,
for example:

```text
{{ hcpVaultSecret "secret_name" }}
{{ hcpVaultSecret "other_secret_name" "other_application_name" }}
```

Structured data from `vlt secrets get --format=json $SECRET_NAME` is available
as the `hcpVaultSecretJson` template function, for example:

```text
{{ (hcpVaultSecretJson "secret_name").created_by.email }}
```

## `vlt` vs `hcp`: Upgrades that Break { id="hcp-broken" }

Hashicorp has ended support for the `vlt` CLI tool (September 2024) and
recommends migrating to the [`hcp` CLI][hcp]. Unfortunately, the new command
does not [work like `vlt`][compat], rendering `hcpVaultSecret` and
`hcpVaultSecretJson` inoperable when using the recommended command-line tool.
[Contributions][contrib] to create new integrations for HCP Vault Secrets are
welcome.

Without these integrations, anyone using HCP Vault Secrets that must upgrade to
the `hcp` client are recommended to use the [`output`][output] and
[`fromJson`][fromjson] functions together:

```ini
{{- $app_name := "my-app-name" -}}
{{- $secret_name := "gdrive-secrets" -}}
{{- $secret :=
    output "hcp" "vs" "s" "open" "--format" "json" "--app" $app_name $secret_name
    | fromJson -}}
[GDrive]
type = drive
client_secret = {{ $secret.static_version.value }}
```

`$HCP_CLIENT_ID` and `$HCP_CLIENT_SECRET` must be set and exported for use in
chezmoi for the above template to work.
