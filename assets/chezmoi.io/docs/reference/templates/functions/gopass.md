# `gopass` *gopass-name*

`gopass` returns passwords stored in [gopass](https://www.gopass.pw/) using the
gopass CLI (`gopass`). *gopass-name* is passed to `gopass show --password
$GOPASS_NAME` and the first line of the output of `gopass` is returned with the
trailing newline stripped. The output from `gopass` is cached so calling
`gopass` multiple times with the same *gopass-name* will only invoke `gopass`
once.

!!! example

    ```
    {{ gopass "$PASS_NAME" }}
    ```
