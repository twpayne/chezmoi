# `passRaw` *pass-name*

`passRaw` returns passwords stored in [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
using the pass CLI (`pass`). *pass-name* is passed to `pass show $PASS_NAME`
and the output is returned. The output from `pass` is cached so calling
`passRaw` multiple times with the same *pass-name* will only invoke `pass`
once.
