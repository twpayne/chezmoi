# Keeper functions

The `keeper*` functions return data from [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/)
[Commander CLI](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/commander-cli) (`keeper`).

The command used can by changed by setting the `keeper.command` configuration
variable, and extra arguments can be added by setting `keeper.args`.
